> Despite efforts to discover the foundations of design thinking in the fine arts, the natural sciences, or most recently, the social sciences, design eludes reduction and remains a surprisingly flexible activity.

尽管人们在努力探索设计思维在艺术、自然科学，以及近年来的社会科学中的基础，设计始终在避免减少，仍然是一个惊人的灵活的活动。



尽管人们很努力地研究在艺术、自然科学和社会科学中的设计思维，但是设计并没有因此减少，仍然保持着它的灵活多样。

> No single definition of design, or branches of professionalized practice such as industrial or graphic design, adequately covers the diversity of ideas and methods gathered together under the label.

单一的设计定义或专业实践分支（如工业设计、平面设计），都没法全面涵盖这个定义下的思想方法的多样性。

> Indeed, the variety of research reported in conference papers, journal articles, and books suggests that design continues to expand in its meanings and connections, revealing unexpected dimensions in practice as well as understanding. 

事实上，在会议论文、期刊文章和书籍中报道的各种研究表明，设计在持续扩展自己的意义和联系，揭示实践中的没有考虑过的维度以及理解。

> This follows the trend of design thinking in the twentieth century, for we have seen design grow from *a trade activity to a segmented profession* to *a field for technical research* and to what now should be recognized as *a new liberal art of technological culture*.

这符合二十世纪设计思维的趋势，因为我们已经看到，设计从贸易活动不断发展到细分行业，再到技术研究领域，现在更像是一种科技潮流下的博雅教育。

> It may seem unusual to talk about design as a liberal art, particularly when many people are accustomed to identifying the liberal arts with the traditional “arts and sciences" that are institutionalized in colleges and universities. 

在很多人习惯用学校里的传统方式——“艺术与科学”——来定义博雅教育的背景下，把设计作为一种博雅教育来谈论似乎是不大常见的。

> But the liberal arts are undergoing a revolutionary transformation in twentieth-century culture, and design is one of the areas in which this transformati onIs strikingly evident.

但博雅教育正在经历二十世纪文化的革命性转变，而设计是这种转型的一个显着的领域。

> To understand the change that is now underway, it is important to recognize that what are commonly regarded as the liberal arts today are not outside of history.

为了理解现在正在发生的变化，一个很重要的认识是，如今的博雅教育的内容并不是什么新东西，绝大部分在过去就有了。

> They originated in the Renaissance and underwent prolonged development that culminated in the nineteenth century as a vision of an encyclopedic education of *beaux arts*, *belles lettres*, history, various natural sciences and mathematics, philosophy, and the fledgling social sciences. 

他们起源于文艺复兴时期，经历了漫长的发展，最终在十九世纪成为了一个包含广泛内容的教育体系，其包含了美学、文学、历史、各种自然科学、数学、哲学，以及刚刚开始发展的社会科学。

> This circle of learning was divided into particular subject matters, each with a proper method or set of methods suitable to its exploration. 

这个学习循环被分成了一些特定的科目，每个科目都有一个适当的方法或适合于其探索的一套方法。

> At their peak as liberal arts, these subject matters provided an integrated understanding of human experience and the array of available knowledge. 

在博雅教育发展高峰期，这些科目提供了对人类经验和知识树的综合理解。

> By the end of the nineteenth century, however, existing subjectsWere explored with progressively more refined methods, and new subjects were added to accord with advances in knowledge.

然而，到了十九世纪末，现有学科的研究方法逐渐更加精细化，新的学科也随着知识的进步而增加。

> As a result, the circle of learning was further divided and subdivided,Until all that remained was a patchwork quilt of specializations.

结果，学习圈被进一步划分和细分，直到剩下的只是一个专业领域下的“拼布床单”。

> Today, these subject matters retain an echo of their old status as liberal arts, but they flourish as specialized studies, leading to the perception of an ever more rich and detailed array of facts and values. 

今天，这些学科，保留旧时博雅教育的影子，但他们的蓬勃发展为专业学科，导向了一个更为详实的知识体系。

> Although these subjects contribute to the advance of knowledge, they also contribute to its fragmentation, as they have become progressively narrow in scope, more numerous, and have lost "connection with each other and with the common problems and matters of daily life from which they select aspects for precise methodological analysis".

虽然这些科目有助于知识的进步，但是它们也造成了知识的碎片化，因为专业知识涉及的范围越来越细，也越来越多，这也导致了各个学科知识间失去了关联，同时这也切断了它们与各种常见问题（比如说各种日常琐事）之间的联系。

?而我们往往是在这些具体的问题中寻找精确的方法分析。?

> The search for new integrative disciplines to complement the arts and sciences has become one of the central themes of intellectual and practical life in the twentieth century. 

寻找新的综合学科来补充旧时博雅教育（艺术和科学）的地位，已成为二十世纪的知识分子和实用?生活?的中心主题之一。

> Without integrative disciplines of understanding, communication, and action, there is little hope of sensibly extending knowledge beyond the library or laboratory in order to serve the purpose of enriching human life.

如果没有理解、交流和行动的综合学科，就不可能合理地探索图书馆或实验室以外的知识，丰富人类生活。

> The emergence of design thinking in the twentieth century is important in this context.

在这一背景下，二十世纪中设计思维的出现是很重要的。

> The significance of seeking a scientific basis for design does not lie in the likelihood of reducing design to one or another of the sciences-an extension of the neo-positivist project and still presented in these terms by some design theorists.

我们为设计寻求科学基础不是为了将设计定义成某种科学——这是新实证主义项目的延伸，而且一些设计理论家仍然用这些术语来圈定设计的内涵。

> Rather, it lies in a concern to connect and integrate useful knowledge from the arts and sciences alike, but in ways that are suited to the problems and purposes of the present. 

相反，它的意义在于连接和整合如同博雅教育中的通用知识，不过区别就是，这些知识是适合解决当前的问题和目的的。

> Designers, are exploring concrete integrations of knowledge that will combine theory with practice for new productive purposes, and this is the reason why we turn to design thinking for insight into the new liberal arts of technological culture.

设计师们正在探索知识的具体整合方法，将理论与实践结合起来，以达到新的生产目的，这就是我们转向设计思维以洞察这种科技文化下的新博雅教育。



## Design and Intentional Operations

> The beginning of the study of design as a liberal art can be traced to the cultural upheaval that occurred in the early part of the twentieth century. 

作为一门博雅教育学科，研究设计的开端可以追溯到二十世纪初发生的文化剧变。

> The key feature of this upheaval was described by John Dewey in *The Questfor Certainty* as the perception of a new center of the universe.

这种聚变的关键特征在约翰·杜威 (John Dewey) 的  The Questfor Certainty 中被描述为一个新的领域中心的感知。

> The old center of the universe was the mind knowing by means of an equipment of powers complete within itself, and merely exercised upon an antecedent external material equally complete within itself.

?旧的领域中心的思想是，通过 自我完成 的 技能/设备 of 能力 来了解，并且仅通过   自我完成 的以前的外部材料  来练习?

> The new center is indefinite interactions taking place within a course of nature which is not fixed and complete, but which is capable of direction to new and different results through the mediation of intentional operations.

新中心是在自然过程中发生的模糊的相互作用，它不是固定、完整的，而是可以通过「刻意行为」来导向新的、不同结果的。

> What Dewey describes here is the root of the difference between the old and new liberal arts, between specialization in the facts of a subject matter and the use of new disciplines of integrative thinking.

?杜威在这里描述的是旧新博雅教育之间的根本区别，也是在客观事物专业细分和新的综合思维的使用的根本区别?

> Dewey observes, however, that the meaning and implications of the new direction are still not fully understood.

然而，杜威观察到，新方向的含义和隐喻还没有完全被理解。

> Nowadays we have a messy conjunction of notions that are consistent neither with one another nor with the tenor of our actual life. 

如今，我们脑海中混杂在一起的概念十分混乱，既不彼此一致，也不符合我们实际生活的节奏。

> Knowledge is still regarded by most thinkers as direct grasp of ultimate reality, although the practice of knowing has been assimilated to the procedure of the useful arts; -involving, that is to say, doing that manipulates and arranges natural energies. 

大多数思想家仍然把知识视为终极现实的直接把握，及时在实践认知中也会使用实用艺术的创作程序。换句话说，就是从自然中获得需要的能量。

> Again while science is said to lay hold of reality, yet“art” instead of being assigned a lower rank is equally esteemed and honored. 

再次需要被强调的，虽然科学是用来把握现实的，但是“艺术”是被平等看待和尊敬的，而不是当成低一等的东西。

Carrying these observations further, Dewey explores the new relationship between science, art, and practice. 

通过持续进一步观察，杜威探索了科学、艺术和实践之间的新关系。

> He suggests in Experience and Nature that knowledge is no longer achieved by direct conformity of ideas with the fixed orders of nature; knowledge is achieved by a new kind of art directed toward orders of change.

在《经验与自然》中他提到知识不再是由思想与自然规律的直接结合而获得的；知识是由一种新的艺术导向的，它是朝向变化的秩序而实现的。

> But if modern tendencies are justified in putting art and creation first, then the implications of this position should be avowed and carried through. 

但如果现代倾向有理由把艺术和创造放在第一位，那么这个位置的影响应公开，并且继续贯彻进行。

> It would then be seen that science is an art, that art is practice, and that the only distinction worth drawing is not be tween practice and theory, but between those modes of practice that are not intelligent, not inherently and immediately enjoyable, and those which are full of enjoyed meanings. 

由此可以看出，科学是一门艺术，而艺术则是实践，唯一值得说明的差别不是实践与理论之间的差别，而是实践模式的区别。因为有的模式不明智、不固有，并且不能立即感受到，而有些则是富有意义。

> Although the neo-positivists courted Dewey for a time, it was apparent that his understanding of the development of science in the twentieth century was quite different from their understanding.

虽然新实证主义曾经尝试过拉拢杜威。但是很明显，他对在第二十世纪科学发展的理解是和他们完全不同的。

> Instead of treating science as primary and art as secondary, Dewey pointed toward science as art.

杜威没有以科学为主，艺术为次，而是把科学当作艺术。

> The consideration that completes the ground for assimIlating science to art is the fact that assignment of scientific status in any given case rests upon facts which are experimentally produced. 

完成科学与艺术的融合，需要考虑是一个事实，那就是在任何情况下，?科学地位的分配?取决于实验的结果。

> Science is now the product of operations deliberately undertaken in conformity with a plan or project that has the properties of a working hypothesis. 

现在的科学是一系列周密计划和精密操作的产物，它现在具有一个很重要的属性就是：?工作假设?。

> What Dewey means by “art”in this context is crucial to understanding the new role of design and technology in contemporary culture.

杜威在这一背景下所指的“艺术”对于理解当代文化中设计和技术的新角色至关重要。

> After a period in which natural knowledge progressed by borrowing from the industrial crafts, science entered upon a period of steady and ever-accelerated growth by means of deliberate invention of such appliances on its own account. 

过去的一个时期内，自然的知识是通过进行工业工艺的实践经验不断增长的，在此之后，科学进入了一个稳定甚至加速增长的时期，这个阶段的特点是，人们基于自己的目的发明了各种具有特定功能的物品。

> In order to mark this differential feature of the art which is science, I shall now use the word “technology”. . 

我用「技术」这个词来说明与“技巧”的科学部分的不同性。

> Because of technologies, a circular relationship between the arts of production and science has been established. 

由于技术的存在，“技巧”当中的生产和科学之间的循环关系已经建立。

> What Dewey defines as technology is not what is commonly understood in today's philosophy of technology. 

杜威所定义的「技术」不是当今普遍理解的技术中的「哲学」。

> Instead of meaning knowledge of how to make and use artifacts or the artifacts themselves, technology for Dewey is an art of experimental thinking. 

杜威的「技术」内涵不是一种关于如何制作和使用工件或人工制品的意义知识，而是一种「实验思维」的技巧。

> It is, in fact, intentional operations themselves carried out in the sciences, the arts of production, or social and political action. 

事实上，它是在科学、生产 技巧或社会和政治行动中进行的刻意行为。

> We mistakenly identify technology with one particular type of product-hardware-that may result from experimental thinking, but overlook the art that lies behind and provides the basis for creating other types of products.

我们错误地将技术当成是一种特定类型的产品硬件，但是忽略了背后的「技巧」——这可能是实验思维造成的——而正是这种「技巧」反而能够为其他类型产品的产品提供创造基础。

> From this perspective, it is easy to understand why design and design thinking continue to expand their meanings and connections in contemporary culture. 

从这个角度来说，我们很容易理解为什么设计和设计思维在当代文化中继续扩展它们的意义和联系。

> There is no area of contemporary life where design——the plan, project, or working hypothesis which constitutes the“intention”in intentional operations——is not a significant factor in shaping human experience.

在当代生活中任何一个领域，设计——那些计划、项目或假设这些构成刻意行为中的“意图”的要素——都是塑造人类经验的重要因素。

>  Design even extends into the core of traditional scientific activities, where it is employed to cultivate the subject matters that are the focus of scientific curiosity. 

设计甚至延伸进了传统科学活动的核心——用来培养科学好奇心的主题——上。

> But perceiving the existence of such an art only opens the door to further inquiry, to explain what that art is, how it operates, and why it succeeds or fails in particular situations. 

但是，意识到这样一种「技术」的存在，仅仅打开了进一步探究的大门，解释了「技术」是什么，它是如何运作的，以及为什么它在特定情况下成功或失败的原因。

> The challenge is to gain a deeper understanding of design thinking so that more cooperation and mutual benefit is possible between those who apply design thinking to remarkably different problems and subject matters. 

目前面临的挑战是需要加深对设计思维的理解，使那些将设计思维应用于显著不同的问题和主题的人之间有更多的合作和互利。

> This will help to make the practical exploration of design, particularly in the arts of production, more intelligent and meaningful.

这将有助于进行实际的设计探索，尤其是在生产「技艺」方面，变得更智能和有意义的。

> However, a persistent problem in this regard is that discussions between designers and members of the scientific community tend to leave little room for reflection on the broader nature of design and its relation to the arts and sciences, industry and manufacturing, marketing and distribution, and the general public that ultimately uses the results of design thinking. 

然而，在这方面，一个长期存在的问题是，设计师和科学界成员之间的讨论往往没有多少空间去思考设计的更广泛的性质及其与艺术和科学、工业与制造、销售与分销，乃至与那些使用设计思维结果的终端用户之间们的关系。

> Instead of yielding productive integrations, the result is often confusion and a breakdown of communication, with a lack of intelligent practice to carry innovative ideas into objective, concrete embodiment. 

这不但导致没法产生高效的整合创新，还造成混乱的结果与沟通上的障碍。也是因为缺乏有效巧妙的实践，创新的思想也没有能够落地到客观、具体的承载物中。

> In turn, this undermines efforts to reach a clearer understanding of design itself, sometimes driving designers back into a defense of their work in the context of traditional arts and crafts. 

反过来，这也破坏了人们尝试去获取对设计本身更清晰的认识的努力，有时还会使得设计师迫不得已退回到传统艺术和工艺的角度为自己的作品进行辩护。

> Without appropriate reflection to help clarify the basis of communication among all the participants, there is little hope of understanding the foundations and value of design thinking in an increasingly complex technological culture.

如果没有适当的反思来帮助澄清所有参与者之间的交流基础，那么在日益复杂的技术文化中理解设计思维的基础和价值就没有什么希望了。

## The Doctrine of Placements 学说/教义/主义/ of 位置/安排

> By “liberal art” I mean a discipline of thinking that may be shared to some degree by all men and women in their daily lives and is,in turn, mastered by a few people who practice the discipline with distinctive insight and sometimes advance it to new areas of innovative application. 

说到“博雅教育”，我的意思这是一门思维的学科，可以在一定程度上共享给日常生活中的任何人。而话又说回来，由少数人——在这个领域反复实践从而获得独特洞察力的人——掌握的学科有时也会推进到新的应用创新领域。 

> Perhaps this is what Herbert Simon meant in The Sciences ofthe Artificial, one of the major works of design theory in the twentieth century, when he wrote：“the proper study of mankind is the science of design, not only as the professional component of a technical education but as a core discipline for every liberally educated man."

也许这就是 **赫伯特·亚历山大·西蒙** 在**《关于人为事物的科学》**写道：“设计科学是对人类的正确研究，它不仅作为技术教育中的专业组成部分，而且还是每个受过良好教育的人都应该学习的核心学科。”这是20世纪的主要设计理论之一。而我提到的「博雅教育」，可能就是西蒙口中的「设计科学」。

> One may reasonably disagree with aspects of Simon's positivist and empiricist view of design as a science  (as one may disagree with the pragmatic principles that stand behind Dewey's observation of the importance of intentional operations in modern culture), but there is little reason to disagree with the idea that all men and women may benefit from an early understanding of the disciplines of design in the contemporary world. 

有人可能会不同意西蒙从实证主义和经验主义方面把设计作为一门科学的观点。因为有人可能会不同意实用主义原则。而正是这个原则支撑了杜威观察的结果： 「刻意行为」在现代文化中举足轻重。但是几乎没有理由反对这样一种观点：所有人都可能从目前的设计学科的初步认识中受益。

> The beginning of such an understanding has already turned the study of the traditional arts and sciences toward a new engagement with the problems of everyday experience, evident in the development of diverse new products which incorporate knowledge from many fields of specialized inquiry.

这种认识的开端已经把传统的艺术和科学导向一种新的对日常生活经验的问题的研究，在各种新产品，将知识从专业调查、多领域发展明显。

在开发多种新产品的过程中，这些知识包含了许多专业调查领域的知识。

这种认识开始已经把传统艺术和科学对日常生活经验的问题的一种新的投入的研究，在各种新产品，将知识从专业查询、多领域发展明显。
