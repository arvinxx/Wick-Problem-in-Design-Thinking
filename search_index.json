认为，当我们去分析这些问题时，「抗解」这个特性会被我们忽略以便于分析问题或进行决策。","设计师在新场景下所面临的挑战时，会让人觉得十分好笑。","设计师往往从普遍和特殊这两个层面构思他们的研究主题。","设计师有意识或无意识地用「置换」工具塑造明确的设计场景，在这个过程中确定所有参与者的看法、他们关注问题以及设计师自己心中用于探索和发展的「基础假设」。","设计师面临的问题是在知道结果之前就去设想和计划不存在的东西。而这个问题往往是在面对「抗解问题」这种存在「不确定性」这样背景下发生的。","设计思维的线性模型是建立在确定条件的基础上的。","设计是一门非常灵活的学科，可以从哲学和实践中得到完全不同的解释。","设计的「抗解问题」理论","设计的不同定义和设计方法的不同叙述是这一广泛主题的主要变量，任何一个具体的可能的探索都是对其意义和含义的发展。","设计的主题在广度上可能是无穷尽的，因为设计思维可以应用于人类经验的任何领域。","设计的历史不仅仅是一个对象的历史。","设计者的主观认知","设计者的任务是精确识别这些条件，然后计算解决方案。","设计问题是不确定的、「抗解」的原因，是设计除了设计师自己设想的以外，没有自己专门研究的主题。","这一点是十分明显的。在1972年","这与科学学科形成了鲜明的对比，这些学科很重要的一块便是理解在已有主题中必然存在的原则、规律或结构。","这些解释经过发展和充分展现后，会变成设计的哲学或者是哲学的初步形态，存在于设计的诸多子领域中。","这在描述","这就是「置换」作为一种设计思维工具所具有的特殊意义。","这就造成了科学家和设计师之间交流的一个中心问题。因为设计者所讨论的问题很少涉及这些主题中的任何一个。","这是一个引人关注的特性清单。如果为了偷点懒，或许我们只需进一步阐述每一个特性的含义，提供从设计思维的各个领域的具体例子来验证就好了。","这是一个设计师们反复切换研究主题视角的历史，具体对象的构思、计划和生产都是这些观点的表达。","这是一种与不确定性有关的整合活动，而不是在根本规则下让人造物的未确定性变得更为确定的活动。","这是希尔伯特·西蒙","这是设计者的观点，例如，“人工”与“自然”。","这有助于解释作为一门综合性学科，设计是如何运足的。","这样的研究主题也许还有待确定，也许是证据不足，需要进一步调查，使之更能够被完全确定。","这次会议因为一些原因变得十分有趣，最重要的一个原因是直接关系到会议本身的内容。","通过使用「置换」来发现或创造一个「基础假设」，设计师建立了一个与科学艺术有关的知识的原则，确定这种知识在特定环境下对于设计思维有多大作用，而不必马上将设计局限到其中任何一个学科中。","问题定义是一个分析过程，设计者在其中确定问题的所有元素，并指定成功的设计解决方案必须具备的所有需求。","问题解决是一个整合的过程，在这个过程中，各种需求相互结合并相互平衡，产生一个最终的方案并进行执行。","难怪设计师和科学界的成员经常沟通困难。","（10）「抗解问题」解决者没有错误的权利——他们是对自己的行为完全负责的。","（1）「抗解问题」没有明确的架构定义，但每一个「抗解问题」都会有其适用的解法框架。","（2）「抗解问题」没有停止的规则。","（3）「抗解问题」没有对或错的解决方案，只有好与坏的解决方案。","（4）在解决「抗解问题」时没有详尽的执行清单。","（5）每一个「抗解问题」总是有多个可能的解释，解释则完全取决于设计师的世界观与人生观。","（6）每一个「抗解问题」都是另一个“更高层次”问题的征兆（一个局部）。","（7）「抗解问题」的框架与解决方案都没有一个明确的测试方法来判断对与错。","（8）解决「抗解问题」是一鼓作气式的，它没有试验和错误的空间。","（9）每一个「抗解问题」都是独一无二的。","？从这个意义上说，西蒙的「人造科学」或许更接近于杜威所说的一种实验思维下的系统学科。？","？因此，每一个接触到设计的科学都倾向于把设计看作是自己知识、方法和原则的“应用”版本。？"],"5-

世纪末，人们用更加精细的方法来探索已有的学科，新的学科随着知识的进步也越来多。结果，整个知识领域被进一步划分和细分，直到其变成一个一堆细分领域「拼凑」而成的“碎布床单”。","全文翻译","在这一背景下，二十世纪中设计思想的出现十分重要。我们为设计寻求科学基础不是为了将设计局限进某种科学定义（不过目前仍然有一些设计理论家用这样的方式来圈定设计的内涵，这就相当于一种新实证主义的解释了）。恰恰相反，我们这么做的意义在于连接和整合如同博雅学科中的一些有用的知识。不过和旧博雅学科的区别在于，这些知识是适用如今存在的各种问题和目的。设计师们如今正在探索知识的具体整合形式，因为这种整合能够把理论与实践结合起来达到创新的目的。这就是为什么我们开始研究设计思想，以求洞察设计这门科技文化下的新博雅学科。","如今，这些学科保留了旧时博雅学科的身份，但他们实际上却是以细分领域的形式蓬勃发展，并使得人们对这些领域下的客观事实和它们的价值有了更加丰富和细致的感知。虽然这些学科有助于知识的进步，但是它们也造成了学科之间的脱节。因为专业知识涉及的范围越来越多，越来越细，这使得它们失去了各个学科本身之间联系，同时这也切断了它们与各种现实中一般问题与事物之间的联系。而事实上，各个学科本该用精确的方法去分析这些一般问题的各个方面。寻找新的综合学科来补充旧时博雅学科（科学艺术）的地位，已成为二十世纪理论和实践的中心课题之一。如果没有一个综合理解、交流和行为的学科，就不可能合理地去探索未知的知识来丰富人类生活。","尽管人们很努力地发现了设计思想存在于艺术、自然科学和社会科学等学科之中的「地基」，但是设计的灵活性和不确定性并没有因此减少。任何一种对设计的定义，或是某个具体的设计领域（如工业设计、平面设计等），都没法全面涵盖所有的设计思想和方法。事实上，在会议论文、期刊文章和书籍中报道的各种研究表明，「设计」在不停地扩大自己的内涵，与其他学科建立更多联系，并在这个过程中揭示出实践中不曾预期的维度信息和认知理解。二十世纪设计思想的趋势正是如此，因为我们已经见证了设计的内容从一个细分行业的贸易活动发展到了对技术领域的研究，如今更是变成了一种科技文化下的新博雅学科。","把设计作为一门博雅学科来谈论似乎非常罕见，尤其是还有很多人习惯用学院派的方式把博雅学科视为传统科学艺术。但博雅学科正在经历二十世纪文化（即科技文化）的革命性转变，而设计正是这种转变特别明显的领域之一。"],"GLOSSARY.html":["04:15:37","05","12","2017","art","arts。我们常常听说","arts），又译为文科教育、人文教育、通才教育、通识教育、素质教育，原是指一个自由的古代西方城市公民所应该学习的基本学科，现代则是作为生活常识的内容，可以在社会学校修习、也可以透过参加展览等方式获得知识。","arts），或自由七艺，是中世纪大学的主要科目。","arvinx","circl","common","construction）概念扮演了尤为重要的角色。","copyright","cultur","design","divid","each","education)，旨在培养具有广博知识和优雅气质的人，让学生摆脱庸俗、唤醒卓异。其所成就的，不是没有灵魂的专门家，而是成为一个有文化的人。","exploration.","further","gitbook该文件修订时间：","learn","liber","liberales，英语：liber","matter","matters,","matters」这个词，为了语句理解通顺，根据语境将其翻译成「主题」或者「学科」。但是根据上下文的语境不同，还需要对这个词有更深一步的理解。主题可能是一类未被规范化的研究领域，而学科则是被规范化了的研究领域。","matters这个词在这篇文章里面既有学科的意思，也有主题的意思。","method","neo","particular","patchwork","positivism）和逻辑经验主义，共同形成了新实证主义，也被称为科学经验主义，是以确证主义为核心的西方哲学运动。1920年代后期开始，一群哲学观点相似的哲学家、科学家和数学家等组成维也纳学派，发展出逻辑实证主义。","positivist","problem","proper","quilt","remain","reserved，pow","result,","right","scienc","set","specializations.","subdivided,until","subject","suitabl","technolog","think","©","《设计思维中的「抗解问题」》术语表","「博雅」的拉丁文原意是“适合自由人”，在古希腊所谓的自由人指的是社会及政治上的精英。古希腊倡导博雅教育(liber","「博雅学科」即西方经典的","一般问题","个人认为是普遍存在于生活中的各种问题，也可以用“通用”、“常见”这样的词来形容这类问题，在翻译上统一采用「一般问题」。","主题/学科","博雅学科","博雅教育（拉丁语：art","在提及博雅学科的时候，有多次提到这个词，那么在这里统一翻译为「知识领域」。","在文章中有很多次提到「subject","它的学习范围被分成了一些特定的学科，每个学科都有一个或者一套适当的、适合于其探索的方法。","它的知识领域被分成了一些特定的学科，每个学科都有一个或者一套适当的、适合于其探索的方法。","实证主义又称实证论，其中心论点是：事实必须是透过观察或感觉经验，去认识每个人身处的客观环境和外在事物。实证论者认为，虽然每个人接受的教育不同，但他们用来验证感觉经验的原则，并无太大差异。实证主义的目的，在希望建立知识的客观性。","实证主义（positivism）是一种以“实际验证”为中心的哲学思想。广义而言，任何种类的哲学体系，只要求知于经验材料，拒绝、排斥先验或形而上学的思辨，都为实证主义。狭义而言，实证主义则指法国哲学家孔德的哲学，认为对现实之认识只有靠特定科学及对寻常事物的观察才能获得。","对经验科学其方法的更深刻认识","应该指代20世纪末的科技浪潮变成了社会的主要文化。","形式逻辑学的发展","文法、修辞与辩证，是博雅教育中的核心部分，被称为三艺（trivium）。至中古时代，它的范围被扩大到包括算术、几何学、音乐以及天文学（其中也包括了占星学），被称为四艺（quadrivium）。三艺与四艺，合称人文七艺（seven","新实证主义者","比如交互设计是一个细分的学科，但是参数化设计只能算是一个主题。而subject","的一种翻译是「博雅教育」，或者是通识教育、素质教育等。但是在这个语境下并不适合用「教育」这个词，因此在本文的翻译中统一采用「博雅学科」。","知识领域","科学艺术","科学艺术基本可以指代博雅学科。","科技文化","结果，整个知识领域被进一步划分和细分，直到其变成一个一堆细分领域「拼凑」而成的“碎布床单”。","维也纳小组的兴趣重点在于对科学的整合和统一，以及对科学方法的正确描绘。他们的认为这些工作将成为诸多形而上学争论的最终解决方案。这样一来，哲学的建设性作用就在于对科学理论和语言的分析。逻辑实证主义运动可以被看做是经验主义哲学的发展。这种发展建立于：","设计思想","词汇/注释术语列表","资料来源：维基百科","这种发展表现在逻辑学对抽象概念进行定义，以及描述合理推论的结构的能力大大增加了。一定程度上，罗素为逻辑实证主义运动奠定了基础。他的逻辑学和“逻辑构造”（logic","逻辑实证主义（英语：logic"]},"length":8},"tokenStore":{"root":{"0":{"3":{"docs":{},":":{"5":{"5":{"docs":{},":":{"5":{"9":{"docs":{"Article.html":{"ref":"Article.html","tf":0.0625}}},"docs":{}},"docs":{}}},"docs":{}},"docs":{}}},"4":{"docs":{"3-设计思维中的置换理论.html":{"ref":"3-设计思维中的置换理论.html","tf":0.0005998800239952009},"4-设计的「抗解问题」理论.html":{"ref":"4-设计的「抗解问题」理论.html","tf":0.0006734006734006734},"5-

...\n前面用了虽然，说明呈现的是一个好的事情，但是实际现状却不好。\n人们希望能够解决设计的不确定性，但是实际上就算发现了设计的地基(不是最关键的，但是是非常重要的)，也没法消除这种不确定性。\ndesign eludes reduction 设计避免减少了什么？是设计活动减少？还是设计的灵活性减少？还是设计的什么东西减少？\n\nNo single definition of design, or branches of professionalized practice such as industrial or graphic design, adequately covers the diversity of ideas and methods gathered together under the label.\n\n任何一种对设计的定义，或是一个具体的设计领域（如工业设计、平面设计），都没法全面涵盖所有的设计思想和方法。\n工业设计也好，视觉设计也好，在设计学的语境下看，有的问题可能适合用工业设计方法，有的问题可能适用视觉传达的方法，有的问题可能都适用而且都需要。而单一的学科领域的方法并没法解决所有的设计问题。\n\nIndeed, the variety of research reported in conference papers, journal articles, and books suggests that design continues to expand in its meanings and connections, revealing unexpected dimensions in practice as well as understanding. \n\n事实上，在会议论文、期刊文章和书籍中报道的各种研究表明，「设计」在不停地扩大自己的内涵，与其他学科建立更多联系，并在这个过程中揭示出实践中不曾预期的维度信息和认知。\nrevealing 是一个动名词，表示一个伴随状态。\n\nThis follows the trend of design thinking in the twentieth century, for we have seen design grow from a trade activity to a segmented profession to a field for technical research and to what now should be recognized as a new liberal art of technological culture.\n\n二十世纪设计思想的趋势正是如此，因为我们已经见证了设计从一个细分行业的贸易活动发展到了研究技术的领域，如今更是变成了一种科技文化下的新博雅学科。\n\nIt may seem unusual to talk about design as a liberal art, particularly when many people are accustomed to identifying the liberal arts with the traditional “arts and sciences\" that are institutionalized in colleges and universities. \n\n把设计作为一门博雅学科来谈论似乎非常罕见，尤其是还有很多人习惯用学院式的方式把博雅学科视为传统科学艺术。\n\nBut the liberal arts are undergoing a revolutionary transformation in twentieth-century culture, and design is one of the areas in which this transformation is strikingly evident.\n\n但博雅学科正在经历二十世纪文化（科技文化）的革命性转变，而设计正是这种转变特别明显的领域之一。\n科技文化再另一个程度上也影响了博雅学科？\n\nTo understand the change that is now underway, it is important to recognize that what are commonly regarded as the liberal arts today are not outside of history.\n\n为了理解现在正在发生的改变，知道如今的博雅学科的内容并不是什么新东西是非常重要的。\n\nThey originated in the Renaissance and underwent prolonged development that culminated in the nineteenth century as a vision of an encyclopedic education of beaux arts, belles lettres, history, various natural sciences and mathematics, philosophy, and the fledgling social sciences. \n\n博雅学科（在这句里更适合称为博雅教育）起源于文艺复兴时期，经历了漫长的发展，最终在19世纪达到了一个极致，成为了一套广博的教育体系，其包含了艺术、文学、历史、各种自然科学、数学、哲学，以及那个时候刚刚兴起的社会科学。\n\nThis circle of learning was divided into particular subject matters, each with a proper method or set of methods suitable to its exploration. \n\n它的知识领域被分成了一些特定的学科，每个学科都有一个或者一套适当的、适合于其探索的方法。\n\nAt their peak as liberal arts, these subject matters provided an integrated understanding of human experience and the array of available knowledge. \n\n在博雅学科发展的鼎盛时期，这些学科能够基于已有知识与人类经验获得一个全面的认知。\n为什么这边把知识与经验分开提？原因是知识是已经被抽象总结了的，是一类显性的信息，而经验则是一种隐藏着的还没有办法被提炼的，算是隐性信息。这句话的意思则是这些学科能够整合显性与隐性的信息来获得一个完整而全面的理解认知。\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, however, existing subjects were explored with progressively more refined methods, and new subjects were added to accord with advances in knowledge.\n\n然而到了十九世纪末，人们用更加精细的方法来探索已有的学科，新的学科随着知识的进步也越来多。\n我觉得这里是不是更适合用「主题」这个词呢？主题可能是一类未被规范化的研究领域，而学科则是被规范化了的研究领域。\n比如交互设计是一个细分的学科，但是参数化设计只能算是一个主题。而subject matters这个词在这篇文章里面既有学科的意思，也有主题的意思。如果要说更加精准的理解，可能翻译的时候得根据上下文来选择合适的词。\n\nAs a result, the circle of learning was further divided and subdivided,until all that remained was a patchwork quilt of specializations.\n\n结果，整个知识领域被进一步划分和细分，直到其变成一个一堆细分领域「拼凑」而成的“碎布床单”。\na patchwork quilt 的意思是「用小块布缝缀的被罩」。这里将细分后的专业领域知识比作是“小块布”，整个知识领域比作“床单”。能够直观感受到，这种床单并不讨人喜欢，因为有着太多的缝合线。完全不如用几块大的布整体制成的床单。\n这和博雅学科面临的情况十分像。博雅学科在19世纪达到巅峰，应该是指那个时期的学科知识「刚刚好」，分化也还没有那么严重，所以每个人都能够对这些学科有个非常全面而整体的认知理解，不至于陷到细节里面。而随着知识领域的划分，对于整体的把握就变得十分困难了。\n\nToday, these subject matters retain an echo of their old status as liberal arts, but they flourish as specialized studies, leading to the perception of an ever more rich and detailed array of facts and values. \n\n如今，这些学科保留了旧时博雅学科的身份，但他们实际上却是以细分领域的形式蓬勃发展，并使得人们对这些领域下的客观事实和它们的价值有了更加丰富和细致的感知。\nan echo of their old status as liberal arts echo 有“回声、回想、重复”这样的意思，这个词组的直译是“旧时博雅学科身份的回声/重复”，从理解上就是说旧时身份的复现，在这里意译为 「保留了旧时博雅学科的身份」\n这句话阐述了如今学科的发展模式的差异，虽然还披着旧时博雅学科的“皮”，但是本质上却是在用细分领域研究方法进行研究。结果上就使得这些学科在探索中获得了非常丰富而细节的知识。\n举个例子，杨志平在[快速写作模式谈]中分析了写作的道与术。(http://www.yangzhiping.com/psy/writers-model.html)\n\n> 中国近代以后落后于西方，很大程度，是我们的文化中充斥着大量不可言说的”道”。一旦探讨写作的具体技巧与指导性、应用性强的术，往往被讥笑。最后，写作的道始终掌握在那些文人手中，站在一个云端来俯视与鄙视那些在金线之下挣扎的百姓们。\n> 但是，真的有必要再使用白首穷经这类低效的写作学习方式吗？西方通过创意写作、分析性写作、有效商务写作、写作QA站点等课程走上了另一条不同的道路。\n作者认为的传统的博雅学科就是研究「道」的问题，而现在变了本质的学科则是开始研究「术」的问题，并获得了大量丰富而细节的知识。\n\nAlthough these subjects contribute to the advance of knowledge, they also contribute to its fragmentation, as they have become progressively narrow in scope, more numerous, and have lost \"connection with each other and with the common problems and matters of daily life from which they select aspects for precise methodological analysis\".\n\n虽然这些学科有助于知识的进步，但是它们也造成了学科之间的脱节。因为专业知识涉及的范围越来越多，越来越细，这使得它们失去了各个学科本身之间联系，同时这也切断了它们与各种现实中一般问题与事物之间的联系。而事实上，各个学科本该用精确的方法去分析这些一般问题的各个方面。\n前面一句话相对好理解，但是后面一句话可能会让人觉得有点难。将专业领域细分之后带来的问题是除了学科本身的脱节，也与与一般问题脱节了。这个应该是对博雅学科的理解上存在偏差。我们可能认为博雅学科不过是一堆细分学科的合集，但是根据作者的意思来看并不是这样。拿一张图看的话是这样的：\n可以注意到博雅学科的中心，或者说聚焦的关键是一般问题，而各个学科从一般问题出发衍生自己学科的知识，并在学科之间互相交叉。\n但是如果将学科细分了，除了学科本身之间没了联系，学科与一般问题之间的联系也被斩断了。\n但是我觉得最困难的一句理解是from which they select aspects for precise methodological analysis。这个 From which 的对象是什么？\n他们从（）中选择方面/面貌来用精细的方法进行分析。\n可以感受到的意思是他们从()的一个方面进行精细化分析。那这个 From Which 的对象是一般问题吗？\n感觉不是，如果是一般问题，那就不会有用精确分析的方法。因为如今现有的学科已经和这个一般问题脱节了。而过去的学科是不会用精确分析的方法的。\n不对，应该就是一般问题，句子逻辑是这样的：他们本该从一般问题去分析，但是现在这个关联被打断了。\n\nThe search for new integrative disciplines to complement the arts and sciences has become one of the central themes of intellectual and practical life in the twentieth century. \n\n寻找新的综合学科来补充旧时博雅学科（科学艺术）的地位，已成为二十世纪理论和实践的中心课题之一。\ndiscipline 作为学科的翻译可能更为合适。\nintellectual and practical life 我翻译为理论和实践。intellectual 意思是”智力的“，practical 意思是”实践的“，这是两个相对的词汇，同时拿来形容 life 的话可以感受到应该是同一个 life 的两个方面，因此理论和实践的意译会比较合理。\n\nWithout integrative disciplines of understanding, communication, and action, there is little hope of sensibly extending knowledge beyond the library or laboratory in order to serve the purpose of enriching human life.\n\n如果没有一个综合理解、交流和行为的学科，就不可能合理地去探索未知的知识来丰富人类生活。\n\nThe emergence of design thinking in the twentieth century is important in this context.\n\n在这一背景下，二十世纪中设计思想的出现是很重要的。\n\nThe significance of seeking a scientific basis for design does not lie in the likelihood of reducing design to one or another of the sciences-an extension of the neo-positivist project and still presented in these terms by some design theorists.\n\n我们为设计寻求科学基础不是为了将设计局限进某种科学定义（不过目前仍然有一些设计理论家用这样的方式来圈定设计的内涵，这就相当于一种新实证主义的解释了）。\n逻辑实证主义和逻辑经验主义，共同形成了新实证主义，也被称为科学经验主义。新实证主义者的研究兴趣在于对科学的整合和统一，以及对科学方法的正确描绘。\n\nRather, it lies in a concern to connect and integrate useful knowledge from the arts and sciences alike, but in ways that are suited to the problems and purposes of the present. \n\n恰恰相反，我们这么做的意义在于连接和整合如同博雅学科中的一些有用的知识。不过和旧博雅学科的区别在于，这些知识是适用如今存在的各种问题和目的。\n\nDesigners, are exploring concrete integrations of knowledge that will combine theory with practice for new productive purposes, and this is the reason why we turn to design thinking for insight into the new liberal arts of technological culture.\n\n设计师们如今正在探索知识的具体整合形式，因为这种整合能够把理论与实践结合起来达到创新的目的。这就是为什么我们开始研究设计思想，以求洞察设计这门科技文化下的新博雅学科。\nturn to 有 ”转向, 变成, 求助于, 起劲地开始行动“的意思。这里是指研究者把目光转向了设计思维，希望能够通过研究清楚设计的思想来洞察设计这门新博雅学科。\nCopyright © ArvinX

Operations.html","title":"设计与「刻意行为」","keywords":"","body":"Design and Intentional Operations / 设计与「刻意行为」\n\nThe beginning of the study of design as a liberal art can be traced to the cultural upheaval that occurred in the early part of the twentieth century. \n\n作为一门博雅学科来研究的话，设计的开端可以追溯到二十世纪初发生的文化剧变。\n\nThe key feature of this upheaval was described by John Dewey in The Quest for Certainty as the perception of a new center of the universe.\n\n这种聚变的关键特征在约翰·杜威 (John Dewey) 的  《确定性的寻求：一种知行关系的研究》中心。\n\nThe old center of the universe was the mind knowing by means of an equipment of powers complete within itself, and merely exercised upon an antecedent external material equally complete within itself.\n\n?旧的领域中心的思想是，通过 自我完成 的 技能/设备 of 能力 来了解，并且仅通过   自我完成 的以前的外部材料  来练习?\n\nThe new center is indefinite interactions taking place within a course of nature which is not fixed and complete, but which is capable of direction to new and different results through the mediation of intentional operations.\n\n新中心是在自然过程中发生的模糊的相互作用，它不是固定、完整的，而是可以通过「刻意行为」来导向新的、不同结果的。\n\nWhat Dewey describes here is the root of the difference between the old and new liberal arts, between specialization in the facts of a subject matter and the use of new disciplines of integrative thinking.\n\n?杜威在这里描述的是旧新博雅学科之间的根本区别，也是在客观事物专业细分和新的综合思维的使用的根本区别?\n\nDewey observes, however, that the meaning and implications of the new direction are still not fully understood.\n\n然而，杜威观察到，新方向的含义和隐喻还没有完全被理解。\n\nNowadays we have a messy conjunction of notions that are consistent neither with one another nor with the tenor of our actual life. \n\n如今，我们脑海中混杂在一起的概念十分混乱，既不彼此一致，也不符合我们实际生活的节奏。\n\nKnowledge is still regarded by most thinkers as direct grasp of ultimate reality, although the practice of knowing has been assimilated to the procedure of the useful arts; -involving, that is to say, doing that manipulates and arranges natural energies. \n\n大多数思想家仍然把知识视为终极现实的直接把握，及时在实践认知中也会使用实用艺术的创作程序。换句话说，就是从自然中获得需要的能量。\n\nAgain while science is said to lay hold of reality, yet“art” instead of being assigned a lower rank is equally esteemed and honored. \n\n再次需要被强调的，虽然科学是用来把握现实的，但是“艺术”是被平等看待和尊敬的，而不是当成低一等的东西。\n\nCarrying these observations further, Dewey explores the new relationship between science, art, and practice. \n\n通过持续进一步观察，杜威探索了科学、艺术和实践之间的新关系。\n\nHe suggests in Experience and Nature that knowledge is no longer achieved by direct conformity of ideas with the fixed orders of nature; knowledge is achieved by a new kind of art directed toward orders of change.\n\n在《经验与自然》中他提到知识不再是由思想与自然规律的直接结合而获得的；知识是由一种新的艺术导向的，它是朝向变化的秩序而实现的。\n\nBut if modern tendencies are justified in putting art and creation first, then the implications of this position should be avowed and carried through. \n\n但如果现代倾向有理由把艺术和创造放在第一位，那么这个位置的影响应公开，并且继续贯彻进行。\n\nIt would then be seen that science is an art, that art is practice, and that the only distinction worth drawing is not be tween practice and theory, but between those modes of practice that are not intelligent, not inherently and immediately enjoyable, and those which are full of enjoyed meanings. \n\n由此可以看出，科学是一门艺术，而艺术则是实践，唯一值得说明的差别不是实践与理论之间的差别，而是实践模式的区别。因为有的模式不明智、不固有，并且不能立即感受到，而有些则是富有意义。\n\nAlthough the neo-positivists courted Dewey for a time, it was apparent that his understanding of the development of science in the twentieth century was quite different from their understanding.\n\n虽然新实证主义曾经尝试过拉拢杜威。但是很明显，他对在第二十世纪科学发展的理解是和他们完全不同的。\n\nInstead of treating science as primary and art as secondary, Dewey pointed toward science as art.\n\n杜威没有以科学为主，艺术为次，而是把科学当作艺术。\n\nThe consideration that completes the ground for assimIlating science to art is the fact that assignment of scientific status in any given case rests upon facts which are experimentally produced. \n\n完成科学与艺术的融合，需要考虑是一个事实，那就是在任何情况下，?科学地位的分配?取决于实验的结果。\n\nScience is now the product of operations deliberately undertaken in conformity with a plan or project that has the properties of a working hypothesis. \n\n现在的科学是一系列周密计划和精密操作的产物，它现在具有一个很重要的属性就是：「基础假设」。\n\nWhat Dewey means by “art”in this context is crucial to understanding the new role of design and technology in contemporary culture.\n\n杜威在这一背景下所指的“艺术”对于理解当代文化中设计和技术的新角色至关重要。\n\nAfter a period in which natural knowledge progressed by borrowing from the industrial crafts, science entered upon a period of steady and ever-accelerated growth by means of deliberate invention of such appliances on its own account. \n\n过去的一个时期内，自然的知识是通过进行工业工艺的实践经验不断增长的，在此之后，科学进入了一个稳定甚至加速增长的时期，这个阶段的特点是，人们基于自己的目的发明了各种具有特定功能的物品。\n\nIn order to mark this differential feature of the art which is science, I shall now use the word “technology”. . \n\n我用「技术」这个词来说明与“技巧”的科学部分的不同性。\n\nBecause of technologies, a circular relationship between the arts of production and science has been established. \n\n由于技术的存在，“技巧”当中的生产和科学之间的循环关系已经建立。\n\nWhat Dewey defines as technology is not what is commonly understood in today's philosophy of technology. \n\n杜威所定义的「技术」不是当今普遍理解的技术中的「哲学」。\n\nInstead of meaning knowledge of how to make and use artifacts or the artifacts themselves, technology for Dewey is an art of experimental thinking. \n\n杜威的「技术」内涵不是一种关于如何制作和使用工件或人工制品的意义知识，而是一种「实验思维」的技巧。\n\nIt is, in fact, intentional operations themselves carried out in the sciences, the arts of production, or social and political action. \n\n事实上，它是在科学、生产 技巧或社会和政治行动中进行的「刻意行为」。\n\nWe mistakenly identify technology with one particular type of product-hardware-that may result from experimental thinking, but overlook the art that lies behind and provides the basis for creating other types of products.\n\n我们错误地将技术当成是一种特定类型的产品硬件，但是忽略了背后的「技巧」——这可能是实验思维造成的——而正是这种「技巧」反而能够为其他类型产品的产品提供创造基础。\n\nFrom this perspective, it is easy to understand why design and design thinking continue to expand their meanings and connections in contemporary culture. \n\n从这个角度来说，我们很容易理解为什么设计和设计思维在当代文化中继续扩展它们的意义和联系。\n\nThere is no area of contemporary life where design——the plan, project, or working hypothesis which constitutes the“intention”in intentional operations——is not a significant factor in shaping human experience.\n\n在当代生活中任何一个领域，设计——那些计划、项目或假设这些构成刻意行为中的“意图”的要素——都是塑造人类经验的重要因素。\n\n Design even extends into the core of traditional scientific activities, where it is employed to cultivate the subject matters that are the focus of scientific curiosity. \n\n设计甚至延伸进了传统科学活动的核心——用来培养科学好奇心的主题——上。\n\nBut perceiving the existence of such an art only opens the door to further inquiry, to explain what that art is, how it operates, and why it succeeds or fails in particular situations. \n\n但是，意识到这样一种「技术」的存在，仅仅打开了进一步探究的大门，解释了「技术」是什么，它是如何运作的，以及为什么它在特定情况下成功或失败的原因。\n\nThe challenge is to gain a deeper understanding of design thinking so that more cooperation and mutual benefit is possible between those who apply design thinking to remarkably different problems and subject matters. \n\n目前面临的挑战是需要加深对设计思维的理解，使那些将设计思维应用于显著不同的问题和主题的人之间有更多的合作和互利。\n\nThis will help to make the practical exploration of design, particularly in the arts of production, more intelligent and meaningful.\n\n这将有助于进行实际的设计探索，尤其是在生产「技艺」方面，变得更智能和有意义的。\n\nHowever, a persistent problem in this regard is that discussions between designers and members of the scientific community tend to leave little room for reflection on the broader nature of design and its relation to the arts and sciences, industry and manufacturing, marketing and distribution, and the general public that ultimately uses the results of design thinking. \n\n然而，在这方面，一个长期存在的问题是，设计师和科学界成员之间的讨论往往没有多少空间去思考设计的更广泛的性质及其与艺术和科学、工业与制造、销售与分销，乃至与那些使用设计思维结果的终端用户之间们的关系。\n\nInstead of yielding productive integrations, the result is often confusion and a breakdown of communication, with a lack of intelligent practice to carry innovative ideas into objective, concrete embodiment. \n\n这不但导致没法产生高效的整合创新，还造成混乱的结果与沟通上的障碍。也是因为缺乏有效巧妙的实践，创新的思想也没有能够落地到客观、具体的承载物中。\n\nIn turn, this undermines efforts to reach a clearer understanding of design itself, sometimes driving designers back into a defense of their work in the context of traditional arts and crafts. \n\n反过来，这也破坏了人们尝试去获取对设计本身更清晰的认识的努力，有时还会使得设计师迫不得已退回到传统艺术和工艺的角度为自己的作品进行辩护。\n\nWithout appropriate reflection to help clarify the basis of communication among all the participants, there is little hope of understanding the foundations and value of design thinking in an increasingly complex technological culture.\n\n如果没有适当的反思来帮助澄清所有参与者之间的交流基础，那么在日益复杂的技术文化中理解设计思维的基础和价值就没有什么希望了。\nCopyright © ArvinX all

discipline of thinking that may be shared to some degree by all men and women in their daily lives and is,in turn, mastered by a few people who practice the discipline with distinctive insight and sometimes advance it to new areas of innovative application. \n\n说到“博雅教育”，我的意思这是一门思维的学科，可以在一定程度上共享给日常生活中的任何人。而话又说回来，由少数人——在这个领域反复实践从而获得独特洞察力的人——掌握的学科有时也会推进到新的应用创新领域。 \n\nPerhaps this is what Herbert Simon meant in The Sciences ofthe Artificial, one of the major works of design theory in the twentieth century, when he wrote：“the proper study of mankind is the science of design, not only as the professional component of a technical education but as a core discipline for every liberally educated man.\"\n\n也许这就是 赫伯特·亚历山大·西蒙 在《关于人为事物的科学》写道：“设计科学是对人类的正确研究，它不仅作为技术教育中的专业组成部分，而且还是每个受过良好教育的人都应该学习的核心学科。”这是20世纪的主要设计理论之一。而我提到的「博雅教育」，可能就是西蒙口中的「设计科学」。\n\nOne may reasonably disagree with aspects of Simon's positivist and empiricist view of design as a science  (as one may disagree with the pragmatic principles that stand behind Dewey's observation of the importance of intentional operations in modern culture), but there is little reason to disagree with the idea that all men and women may benefit from an early understanding of the disciplines of design in the contemporary world. \n\n有人可能会不同意西蒙从实证主义和经验主义方面把设计作为一门科学的观点。因为有人可能会不同意实用主义原则。而正是这个原则支撑了杜威观察的结果： 「刻意行为」在现代文化中举足轻重。但是几乎没有理由反对这样一种观点：所有人都可能从目前的设计学科的初步认识中受益。\n\nThe beginning of such an understanding has already turned the study of the traditional arts and sciences toward a new engagement with the problems of everyday experience, evident in the development of diverse new products which incorporate knowledge from many fields of specialized inquiry.\n\n这种认识的开端已经把传统的艺术和科学导向一种新的对日常生活经验的问题的研究。而这在各种新产品的开发过程中尤为明显，因为这个过程中需要将各个专业领域的知识整合起来。\n\nTo gain some idea of how extensively design affects contemporary life, consider the four broad areas in which design is explored throughout the world by professional designers and by many others who may not regard themselves as designers. \n\n为了了解设计对当今生活有多广泛的影响，可以这四个主要的领域进行探究。因为全世界绝大多数专业设计师和其他许多设计爱好者都在探索这四个领域。\n\nThe first of these areas is the design of symbolic and usual communications. \n\n第一个是符号和传达的设计——视觉传达。\n\nThis includes the traditional work of graphic design, such as typography and advertising, book and magazine production, and scientific llustration, but has expanded into communication through photography, film, television, and computer display. \n\n其包括传统的平面设计，如排版印刷、广告、书籍杂志的装帧印刷、专业插画等，同时也扩展到了摄影、电影、电视和数字传媒。\n\nThe area of communications design is rapidly evolving into a broad exploration of the problems of communicating information, ideas, and arguments through a new synthesis of words and images that is transforming the “bookish culture” of the past.\n\n传达设计正迅速发展成为一个新的宽广的研究领域。通过融合语言和图像的一个新的手段（电子传媒），来探讨传达设计中的信息、思想和争论的问题。而这种手段正在转变过去「用书传达」的文化。\n\nThe second area is the design of material objects. \n\n第二个领域是则是实体设计——产品设计。\n\nThis includes traditional concern for the form and visual appearance of everyday products——clothing, domestic objects, tools, instruments, machinery, and vehicles——but has expanded  into a more thorough and diverse interpretation of the physical, psychological, social, and cultural relationships between products and human beings. \n\n这包括产品造型和视觉感知之间关联的传统领域，服装、家具、工具、仪器、机械和交通工具。? 同样的，它也已经扩展成对人和物之间的身心、社会文化关系的更彻底、更多样的理解。?\n\nThis area is rapidly evolving into an exploration of the problems of construction in which form and visual appearance must carry a deeper, more integrative argument that unites aspects of art, engineering and natural science, and the human sciences.\n\n?这一领域正在迅速发展为探索，形式和视觉的外观必须进行更深入的解释、更综合的论证，将艺术、工程和自然科学以及人类科学的各个方面结合起来。?\n\nThe third area is the design of activities and organized services, which includes the traditional management concern for logistics, combining physical resources, instrumentalities, and human beings in efficient sequences and schedules to reach specified objectives. \n\n第三个领域则是活动和合理的组织服务——设计管理。其中包括传统的组织工作管理，将物理资源、媒介资源和人力资源有效整合进工作流与计划表中，以达到预期或指定的目标。\n\nHowever, this area has expanded into a concern for logical decision making and strategic planning and is rapidly evolving into an exploration of how better design thinking can contribute to achieving an organic flow of experience in concrete situations, making such experiences more intelligent, meaningful, and satisfying. \n\n然而，这一领域已扩展到逻辑决策和战略规划的关注范围，并正在迅速演变为探索在具体场景下设计思维如何更好地帮助实现?系统的经验流?，使这种经验更加智能、有意义和令人满意。\n\nThe central theme of this area is connections and consequences. \n\n这一领域的中心主题是关联与次序（因果关系）。\n\nDesigners are exploring a progressively wider range of connections in everyday experience and how different types of connections affect the structure of action.\n\n设计师们正在探索日常生活中越来越广泛的联系，以及不同类型的联系如何影响行动的结构。\n\nThe fourth area is the design of complex systems or environments for living, working, playing, and learning. \n\n第四个领域则是为生活、工作、娱乐和学习而设计的复杂系统或环境——系统设计。\n\nThis includes the traditional concerns of systems engineering, architecture, and urban planning or the functional analysis of the parts of complex wholes and their subsequent integration in hierarchies. \n\n这包括了系统工程和建筑的范围，以及城市规划、复杂整体的局部功能分析和再复合时的层级分析。\n\nBut this area has also expanded and reflects more consciousness of the central idea, thought, or value that expresses the unity of any balanced and functioning whole. \n\n但这个领域也扩大了，反映了更多的核心思想、思想或价值的意识，表达了任何平衡和功能整体的统一。\n\nThis area is more and more concerned with exploring the role of design in sustaining, developing, and integrating human beings into broader ecological and cultural environments, shaping these environments when desirable and possible or adapting to them when necessary.\n\n这一领域一方面越来越关注于探索设计在人类与更广泛的生态和文化环境维持、发展和整合过程中的角色，另一方面也在探索在某些情况下塑造环境，某些情况下适应环境时设计的作用。\n\nReflecting on this list of the areas of design thinking, it is tempting to identify and limit specific design professions within each area——graphic designers with communication, industrial designers and engineers with material objects, designers-cum-managers with activities and services, and architects and urban planners with systems and environments. \n\n反思以上设计思维关注的领域，很容易识别和限定出特定该领域下的设计职业类型--比如视觉传达领域的平面设计师，工业设计领域的工业设计师和工程师们、设计管理领域的设计管理者，环境系统设计下的建筑师和城市规划师。\n\nBut this would not be adequate, because these areas are not simply categories of objects that reflect the results of design. \n\n但这并不恰当，因为这些领域的划分不是简简单单地根据设计结果进行分类的。\n\nProperly understood and used, they are also places of invention shared by all designers, places where one discovers the dimensions of design thinking by a reconsideration of problems and solutions.\n\n正确地理解和使用的方法应该是，它们也是所有设计师共享的发明的领域，人们在这些领域下通过重新思考问题和方案来发现设计思维的不同维度。\n这里开始就有点超出个人能力范围了。\n\nTrue, these four areas point toward certain kinds of objectivity in human experience, and the work of designers in each of these areas has created a framework for human experience in contemporary culture. \n\n的确，这四个领域指向人类经验中的某些客观性，同时如今的设计师在这些领域中的工作也为人类的体验创造了一个框架。\n\nBut these areas are also interconnected, with no priority given to any single one. \n\n但这些领域也是相互关联的而平等的，任何一个都不应该被优先考虑。\n\nFor example, the sequence of signs, things, actions, and thought could be regarded as an ascent from confusing parts to orderly wholes. \n\n例如，符号、实物、行动和思想的一个次序可以被视为从混乱部分到有序整体的一个上升梯度。\n\nSigns and images are fragments of experience that reflect our perception of material objects.\n\n符号和图像是反映我们对实物的感知的经验片段。\n\nMaterial objects, in turn, become instruments of action. \n\n紧接着，实物成为行动的工具。\nSigns, things, and actions are organized in complex environments by a unitying idea or thought. \n符号、实物和行动组织在复杂的环境中，由一个统一的观念或思想组织在一起。\n\nBut there is no reason to believe that parts and wholes must be treated in ascending rather than descending order.\n\n但是没有理由可以认为部分与整体的次序必须是上升的而不是下降。\n\nParts and whole are of many types and may be defined in many ways.\n\n毕竟零件和整体有很多种类，并且可以用多种方式加以定义。\n\nDepending on how a designer wishes to explore and organize experience, the sequence could just as reasonably be regarded as a descent from chaotic environments to the unity provided by symbols and images. \n\n根据设计者希望如何探索和组织经验，整个序列可以合理地被视为一种从混乱环境到统一符号的下降梯度。\n交互设计中的原子设计系统是不是类似的东西呢？\n\nIn fact, signs, things, actions, and thoughts are not only interconnected, they also interpenetrate and merge in contemporary design thinking with surprising consequences for innovation. \n\n事实上，符号，实物，行动和思想不仅是相互关联的，它们也互相渗透与融合，在吸收当代的设计思维后与令人惊讶的因果关系，从而诞生创新。\n说的比较虚，没有太好的感知。\n\nThese areas suggest the lineage of design's past and present, as well as point to where design is headed in the future.\n\n这些领域暗示了设计的历史与当今的脉络，以及指向未来设计的方向。\n的确从历史中是可以看出未来的设计方向。至少目前了解到「设计认知」——即如何把设计当做一门科学来研究——变得越来越热门了。尤其是 AI 的逐渐成熟与发展。\n\nIt is easy to understand that industrial designers are primarily concerned with material objects. \n\n这是很容易理解的，工业设计主要是关注实体产品。\n\nBut the research reported in design literature shows that industrial designers have found new avenues of exploration by thinking about material objects in the context of signs, actions, and thoughts. \n\n但在设计文献中报道的研究表明，工业设计师们通过在符号、行为和思想的背景下思考产品，找到了新的探索途径。\n有这一类的研究？感觉可以去找找看？通过研究平面、行为和思想可以得到新的设计方向？参数化设计算不算是呢？\n\nFor example, some have considered material objects communicative, yielding reflections on the semantic and rhetorical aspects of products. \n\n例如，有些人认为产品也有传达属性，从而产生了对产品的语义和修辞方面的思考。\n的确是有吧，比如我们肯定都会学到的什么语义语用语境，但是虽然是一个方法论，但是可用性其实没有那么强？原来是从这里来的？\nOthers have placed material objects in the context of experience and action, asking new questions about how products function in situations of use and how they may contribute to or inhibit the flow of activities. \n另一些人把产品放在经验和行为的场景下，提出关于「产品在使用情况下如何运作」、「产品如何辅助或抑制人的行为流」这样的一些新的问题。\n感觉比如应放天的那一套理论就是这么去做的\n\n(Of course, this is a significant shift from questions about the internal functioning of products and how the visual form of a product expresses such functioning.) \n\n（显然，从问题层面来说，这是一个重大的转变。因为以前我们总是去问「产品内部功能如何运作」或者「产品的视觉形式如何表达」这一类问题。\n的确，内部因素转向外部因素是一个重要的改变，更多地去考虑人的因素。以做到以用户为中心的设计。可能这边更多在说的诺曼提出来的那一类的设计方法。\n\n\nFinally, others are exploring material objects as part of larger systems, cycles, and environments, opening up a wide range of new questions and practical concerns or reenergizing old debates. \n\n还有一些人在探索产品作为系统和环境的一部分的时候，开拓了一系列广泛的新问题和实际问题的探讨，或者重新发起一些旧的话题的讨论。\n\nIssues include conservation and recycling, alternative technologies, elaborate simulation environments, smart products, virtual reality, artificial life, and the ethical, political, and legal dimensions of design.\n\n问题包括节能和循环利用、替代技术、精细仿真环境、智能产品、虚拟现实、人工生命，乃至设计中的伦理、政治和法律的维度。\n这个还是有点厉害了，绿色、节能、智能产品、虚拟现实这些都有存在，在帕帕纳克的设计反思中肯定也有提到。那设计的伦理、政治和法律问题这个就很有趣了。\n哪里有对应的案例呢？汽车的法规算不算？\n\nComparable movements are evident in each of the design professions: their primary concern begins in one area, but innovation comes when the initial selection is repositioned at another point in the framework, raising new questions and ideas. \n\n每一个专业设计领域的行为是十分相似的：他们主要关心点从一个领域开始，但是当在初始关注的焦点移动到框架中的另一点，并提出了新的问题和想法时，创新就出现了。\n\nExamples of this repositioning abound. For example, architecture has traditionally been concerned with buildings as large systems or environments. \n\n这种换位思考的例子比比皆是。例如，建筑传统上把建筑物当作大型系统或环境。\n\nFor nearly twenty years, however, a group of architects have aggressively sought to reposition architecture in the context of signs,symbols, and visual communication, yielding the post modern experiment and trends such as deconstructionist architecture. \n\n近二十年，然而，一组建筑师积极寻求建筑在标志、符号、视觉传达这个情境下的新的形式和位置，产生出后现代主义的实验和趋势，比如解构主义建筑。\n\nOxymorons such as “deconstructionist architecture” are often the result of attempts at innovative repositioning. \n\n类似“解构主义建筑”这种「矛盾体」往往是创新的重新定位后进行尝试的成果。\nOxymoron 来自希腊语oxymoron,敏锐的傻瓜，来自oxys,锐利的，敏锐的，moron,傻瓜。后语言学家借用该词来表达矛盾修辞法。\n英文解释是 two words used together which have, or seem to have, opposite meanings \n简单来说就是「矛盾」，但是这里需要考虑一下为什么解构主义建筑这样的词是 Oxymoron。\n建筑是结构，而修饰语是解构。所以字面上地区是矛盾体，但是内涵上呢？为什么他们被称为矛盾体？为什么要叫做解构主义？\n\nThey indicate a desire to break old categories, as in the now familiar and accepted \"constructivist art\" and \"action painting\". \n\n他们表示想要打破旧的类别，就像现在熟悉的和被广泛接受的“构成艺术”和“行为绘画”一样。\n\nThe test, of course, is whether experiments in innovation yield productive results, judged by individuals and by society as a whole. \n\n当然，这种测试，是由独立个体和全社会来判断其创新实验是否能产生有成效的结果。\n\nSome experiments have fallen like dead leaves at the first frost, swept away to merciful oblivion.\n\n有些实验在初冬时的枯叶一样凋零，被世间遗忘。\n\nAt present, the results of deconstructionist architecture are mixed, but the experiment will continue until individuals or groups reposition the problems of architecture and shift general attention toward new questions.\n\n目前，解构主义建筑的结果是多方面的，但实验将持续下去，直到个体或群体将建筑的问题再次重新定位，或者把注意力转移到新问题上为止。\n其实个人感觉建筑学更多都在研究参数化设计，相当于是把注意力转移到了新的问题上。\n\nA strikingly different repositioning is now beginning in the profession of graphic design and visual communication. \n\n一个显著不同的重新定位现在开始在平面设计和视觉传达行业。\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, graphic design was oriented toward personal expression through image making. \n\n第十九世纪末和第二十世纪初，平面设计从图形创作转向个人表达。\n\nIt was an extension of the expressiveness of the fine arts, pressed into commercial or scientific service. \n\n艺术表现力的延伸向商业或专业的服务。\n\nThis was modified under the influence of “communication theory” and semiotics when the role of the graphic designer was shifted toward that of an interpreter of messages. \n\n在传达理论和符号学的影响下被逐渐修正。这个过程中，平面设计师的角色也逐渐转向信息的传达者。\n说实话这一段话真的非常拗口。简单来说就是从一个艺术家变成一个设计师。从以前为自己表达逐渐转变成为他人表达。比如设计 LOGO、名片、海报等等\n\nFor example, the graphic designer introduced emotional colorings of corporate or public  “messages”  or, in technical terms, the graphic designer “coded” the corporate message. \n\n?例如，平面设计师利用色彩为企业传达感情基调，或者其他公众的信息。从技术角度来说的话，平面设计师为企业客户想要传达的信息重新「编码」。?\n这段话也是好难翻译！\n\nAs a result, the products of graphic design were viewed as \"things\" or “entities”（material texts) to be “decoded” by spectators. \n\n因此，平面设计的产品可以被视为实体（物理材料），被观众“解码”。\nRecently, however, a new approach in graphic design thinking has begun to question the essentially linguistic or grammatical approach of communications theory and semiotics by regarding visual communication as persuasive argumentation.\n然而，近年来，平面设计思维中的一种新方法开始质疑基于语义学的传达理论和符号学的方法论是不是最本质的方法，他们认为视觉传达本身才是为有说服力的依据。\n这个有趣？是不是在平面设计法则之前就是用语义学的方式在做传达设计呢？\n\nAs this work unfolds, it will likely seek to reposition graphic design within the dynamic flow of experience and communication, emphasizing rhetorical relationships among graphic designers, audiences, and the content of communication. \n\n这部分展开来说的话，它可能会寻求在经验和传达的动态流程中重新定位平面设计，强调平面设计师、受众和传达内容之间的修辞关系。\n修辞关系是一个很奇特的词。这方面真没有任何研究\n\nIn this situation, designers would no longer be viewed as individuals who decorate messages, but as communicators who seek to discover convincing arguments by means of a new synthesis of images and words. \n\n在这种情况下，设计师将不再被看作是“装饰”信息的人，而是作为一个沟通者，他们试图通过一种新的图像和文本的综合方法来发现有说服力的证据。\n这里的装饰可以认为是单方面的设计信息。而后者的话，就是从沟通者的角度出发，来思考受众需要什么样的信息，通过一套方法来寻找出最容易让受众接受的信息处理手段。\n\nIn turn, this will shift attention toward audiences as active participants in reaching conclusions rather than passive recipients of preformed messages.\n\n于是，这将会使得设计师的注意力转移到观众身上，寻求他们的积极参与以达成结果，而不是被动地接受预先形成的信息。\n比较好奇目前有这套方法论吗？我知道现在的营销可以从文案出发思考用户需求来做文案设计，平面设计可行吗？\n\nWhat works for movements within a design profession also works for individual designers and their clients in addressing specific problems. \n\n对设计行业中的动作起作用的也适用于独立设计师和客户解决特定问题的方法。\n\nManagers of a large retail chain were puzzled that customers had difficulty navigating through their stores to find merchandise. \n\n一家大型零售连锁店的经理们很困惑，顾客很难通过他们的商店来寻找商品。\n\nTraditional graphic design yielded larger signs but no apparent improvement in navigation the larger the sign, the more likely people were to ignore it.\n\n传统的平面设计做了更大的符号标记，但引导效果没有明显的改善，越大的标志，人们就越可能忽视它。\n\nFinally, a design consultant suggested that the problem should be studied from the perspective of the flow of customer experience. \n\n最后，一位设计顾问建议，应该从顾客体验的角度来研究这个问题。\n\nAfter a period of observing shoppers walking through stores, the consultant concluded that people often navigate among different sections of a store by looking for the most familiar and representative examples of a particular type of product. \n\n经过一段时间的观察购物者经过商店，顾问得出结论：人们经常浏览商店的不同部分，会寻找最熟悉和具有代表性的特定类型的产品例子。\n\nThis led to a change in display strategy, placing those products that people are most likely to identify in prominent positions. \n\n这导致了展示策略的改变——将人们最可能识别的产品放置在显眼的位置。\n\nAlthough this is a minor example, it does illustrate a double repositioning of the design problem: first, from signs to action, with an insight that people look for familiar products to guide their movements; second ld, from action to signs, a redesign of display strategy to employ products themselves as signs or clues to the organization of a store.\n\n虽然这是一个很小的例子，但它说明了一个双向重定位的设计问题：首先，通过对人们寻找熟悉的产品来指导他们的动作的洞察，将符号维度转向行为维度；第二，从行为再到符号，重新设计的展示策略将使用的产品作为标志或线索作为整个商店的组织模式。\n\nThere are so many examples of conceptual repositioning in design that it is surprising no one has recognized the systematic pattern of invention that lies behind design thinking in the twentieth century. \n\n在设计中有很多概念重定位的例子，暗示令人惊讶的是，还没有人认识到在二十世纪设计思维背后的系统范式。\n要不是辛向阳老师今年的各种演讲中开始提到这篇文章，我想现在我也还是觉得设计思维是一种很虚的东西。没有框架，只有靠运气。\n\nThe pattern is found not in a set of categories but in a rich，diverse, and changing set of placements, such as those identified by signs, things, actions, and thoughts.\n\n这种模式不是在一组类别中找到的，而是在一系列丰富、多样和不断变化的位置中找到的，如通过符号、产品、行为和思想确定的位置。\n\nUnderstanding the difference between a category and a placement is essential if design thinking is to be regarded as more than a series of creative accidents. \n\n如果设计思维被认为是一系列创造性以外，那么理解「分类」和「置换」之间的区别是很重要的。\n\nCategories have fixed meanings that are accepted within the framework of a theory or a philosophy, and serve as the basis for analyzing what already exists. \n\n分类有明确的意义，在理论或哲学的框架内可被接受，并可以作为已有的分析基础。\n在这个语境下，分类可能就是那四个类别：符号、产品、行为和思想。那么随着时间的发展，会不会有新的类别产生呢？\n\nPlacements have boundaries to shape and constrain meaning, but are not rigidly fixed and determinate. \n\n「置换」有塑造边界和限制意义，但不是固定不变的。\n突然理解Placements是什么了。这是一种变换方法。就像 CG 领域里面有置换贴图一样，这里意味着空间位置的变换。在 Fixed 的类别下应用置换，就可以获得新的场景的感知。那么下面那段话就能说得通了。\n\nThe boundary of a placement gives a context or orientation to thinking, but the application to a specific situation can generate a new perception of that situation and ,hence, a new possibility to be tested. \n\n「置换」的边界给思考提供了一个情景和方向，但是应用到一个特定的情境可以产生对这种情况的新的感知，因此，就会产生一种新的可以去测试的可能性。\n在直观感受上就是可能看问题的视角进行了特殊的变换。\n柳冠中的《设计事理学》的角度，从产品中抽象人们背后的需求。\n\nTherefore, placements are sources of new ideas and possibilities when applied to problems in concrete circumstances.\n\n因此，当应用于具体情况的问题时，「置换」是新点子和可能性的来源。\n\nAs an ordered or systematic approach to the invention of possibilities, the doctrine of placements provides a useful means of understanding what many designers describe as the intuitive or serendipitous quality of their work. \n\n?作为一个有序的或可能的发明的系统方法，「置换」原则提供了一个有用的方法来理解许多设计师描述的他们直觉的或偶然的工作质量。?\n那这个原则在哪有呢？如果有可以描述的话，那么就有可能规范化，和 Ai 化了。\n\nIndividual designers often possess a personal set of placements, developed and tested by experience. \n\n个人设计师通常拥有一套个人的置换方法集，通过经验来发展和测试。\n24) Some placements have become so common in twentieth-century design that they hardly attract attention.\n\nNonetheless, such placements are classic features of design thinking, and in the hands of a skilled designer retain\n\ntheir inventive potential. Designer Jay Doblin sometimes employed a cascade of placements stemming from the basic placement“intrinsic/extrinsic. \" Doblin's placements serve as a heuristic device to reveal the factors in design thinking and product development. Other placements are described by Doblin in “Innovation, A Cook Book Approach“, n. D. (Typewitten.) \n\nWith different intent, Ezio Manzini recently argued that the designer needs two mental instruments with opposite qualities to examine a design situation: a microscope and a macroscope. The mental microscope is for examining\"how things work, down to the smallest details, \" particularly in regard to advances in materials science. A further series of placements fill out the microscope to give it efficacy. See Ezio Manzini, The Materials of Invention: Materials and Design  (Cambridge: M. I. T. Press,1989),58.\n这是其中一个注解，等下再翻译下。\n\nThe inventiveness of the designer lies in a natural or cultivated and artful ability to return to those placements and apply them to a new situation, discovering aspects of the situation that affect the final design. \n\n设计师的创造性在于利用一种自然的、文化性的、巧妙的能力来得到一些「置换」的方法，并将这些方法应用到一种新的情境中，从而发现影响最终设计的情况的各个方面。\n\nWhat is regarded as the designer's style, then, is sometimes more than just a personal preference for certain types of visual forms, materials, or techniques; it is a characteristic way of seeing possibilities through conceptual placements. \n\n那什么是设计师的风格呢？很多时候，这不是一种视觉形式、材料或者技术的个人偏好；而是一种通过特定「置换」后看到设计可能性的独特方式。\n\nHowever, when a designer's conceptual placements become categories of thinking, the result can be mannered imitations of an earlier invention that are no longer relevant to the discovery of specific possibilities in a new situation.\n\n然而，当设计师的概念「置换」法成为思考的类别时，那结果可能是对早期创造物的矫饰模仿，而这种新发明不再与新情况下特定可能性的发现相关。\n说人话可能就是，当你用的「置换」方法变得循规蹈矩时，那么最后得到的结果可能就是没什么新意的，而且可能并没有和具体场景能够产生关联性。\n\nIdeas are then forced onto a situation rather than discovered in the particularities and novel possibilities of that situation.\n\n点子就会被强加到这个场景中，而不是从这个场景的特殊性和新的可能性中被发现。\n\nFor the practicing designer, placements are primary and categories are secondary. \n\n对于在工作的设计师来说，「置换」是主要的方法，「分类」是次级的方法。\n\nThe reverse holds true for design history, theory, and criticism, except at those moments when a new direction for inquiry is opened. \n\n相反，设计历史、理论和批评都是如此，只是在新的调查方向被打开的时刻除外。\n\nAt such times, a repositioning of the problems of design, such as a change in the subject matter to be addressed, the methods to be employed, or the principles to be explored, occurs by means of placements. \n\n在这种情况下，设计问题的重定位，例如将要变化解决的主题的位置、采用的方法、或要探索的原则，都应该要通过「置换」的方法来实现。\n\nThen, history, theory, or criticism are “redesigned” for the individual investigator and sometimes for groups of investigators. \n\n?然后，历史、理论或批评被个别调查员或者研究小组“重新设计”时也是应该这么用。?\n这里不是很确定省略的意义，可能是翻译的意义不一定对额。\n\nAs the discipline of design studies adds a reflective and philosophic dimension to design history, theory, and criticism, positive consequences are possible. \n\n由于设计研究的学科增加了设计历史、理论和批评的反思和哲学层面，正向的因果结果是可能的。\n卧槽，到这边就一脸懵逼了，没有可以去理解的案例额。\n\nHistorians, for example, may reconsider the placement of design history as it has been practiced throughout most of the twentieth century and work to discover other innovative possibilities.\n\n例如，历史学家可能会重新考虑设计历史的「置换」方法，因为它在二十世纪的大部分时间里都被实践过，并致力于发现其他创新的可能性。\n\nDiscontent with the results of current design history suggests that new repositionings are called for if the discipline is to retain vitality and relevance to contemporary problems. \"\n\n对目前的设计历史的结果不满的人认为，如果设计学科要保持活力和与当代问题的相关性，那么我们必须对设计历史做一次新的重定位。\n\nThe doctrine of placements will require further development if it is to be recognized as a tool in design studies and design thinking, but it can also be a surprisingly precise way of addressing conceptual space and the non-dimensional images from which concrete possibilities emerge for testing in objective circumstances.\n\n「置换理论」将需要进一步发展，如果它要被认为是设计研究和设计思维的工具，但它也可以是解决概念空间和无量纲图像的一种令人惊讶的精确方法，?从具体的可能性出现在客观情况下进行测试。?\n\nThe natural and spontaneous use of placements by designers is already evident; an explicit understanding of the doctrine of placements will make it an important element of design as a liberal art.\n\n设计师自然地、自发地使用「置换」是十分很明显的；对「置换理论」的透彻理解将使它成为博雅教育中的一个重要元素。\n\nAll men and women require a liberal art of design to live well in the complexity of the framework based in signs, things, actions, and thoughts.\n\n为了在符号、实体、行为和思想复杂框架下更好地地生活，每个人都应该接受设计的博雅教育。\n\nOn one hand, such an art will enable individuals to participate more directly in this framework and contribute to its development. \n\n一方面，这种教育将使个人能够更直接地参与这一框架，并有助于其发展。\n\nOn the other, professional designers could be regarded as masters in its exploration.\n\n另一方面，专业设计师可以被视为探索的大师。\n\nThe ability of designers to discover new relationships among signs, things, actions, and thoughts is one indication that design is not merely a technical specialization but a new liberal art.\n\n设计师探索符号、实体、行为和思想之间的新关系的能力象征着设计不仅仅是一门高度专业化的职业，更是一种博雅教育。\nCopyright © ArvinX all right reserved，powered by Gitbook该文件修订时间：\n2017-12-04

evidence of a coherent, if not always systematic, effort to reach a clearer understanding of design as an integrative discipline. \n\n从最近的一些设计会议可以看到大家为了更清楚地理解设计作为一门综合性学科时的内涵而付出的持续努力。\n\nHowever, the participants, who increasingly come from diverse professions and academic disciplines, are not drawn together because they share a common definition of design, a common methodology, a common philosophy, or even a common set of objects to which everyone agrees that the term “design”should be applied.\n\n然而，越来越多来自不同行业和学科的参与者都同意用“设计”这个词。并不是因为他们有共同的设计定义，共同的方法论，共同的哲学，甚至是共同的对象群，\n\n They are drawn together because they share a mutual interest in a common theme: the conception and planning of the artificial. \n\n他们聚集在一起是因为他们对一个共同的主题有共同的兴趣：人工的概念和规划。\n\nDifferent definitions of design and different specifications of the methodology of design are variations of this broad theme, each a concrete exploration of what is possible in the development of its meanings and implications. \n\n设计的不同定义和设计方法的不同叙述是这一广泛主题的主要变量，任何一个具体的可能的探索都是对其意义和含义的发展。\n\nCommunication is possible at such meetings because the results of research and discussion, despite wide differences in intellectual and practcal perspectives, are always connected by this theme and, therefore, supplemental.\n\n在这些会议交流是可能的，因为尽管在知识和实践方面存在巨大差异，但是研究和讨论的结果总是以这个主题互相连接和补充。\n\n This is only possible, of course, if individuals have the wit to discover what is useful in each other's work and can cast the material in terms of their own vision of design thinking.\n\n当然，这是只有满足这个添加才是可能的：每个人都有智慧去发现在彼此的工作中有用的东西，并且可以根据他们自己的设计思维来重新梳理材料。\n所以说多看看别的人实践也能够去补充自己的实践案例，用来增加设计思维的案例。\n\nMembers of the scientific community, however, must be puzzled by the types of problems addressed by professional designers and by the patterns of reasoning they employ. \n\n然而，科学界的成员一定会对专业设计师解决问题的类型和他们所采用的推理模式感到困惑。\n\nWhile scientists share in the new liberal art of design thinking, they are also masters of specialized subject matters and their related methods, as found in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, the social sciences, or one of the many subfields into which these sciences have been divided. \n\n?而在设计思维的新博雅教育分享的科学家?，他们还是其他相关专业学科及其相关方法的大师，比如在物理学、化学、生物学、数学、社会科学，或其中任何一个学科分支。\n\nThis creates one of the central problems of communication between scientists and designers, because the problems addressed by designers seldom fall solely within the boundaries of any one of these subject matters.\n\n这就造成了科学家和设计师之间交流的一个中心问题。因为设计者所讨论的问题很少涉及这些主题中的任何一个。\n\nThe problem of communication between scientists and designers was evident in a special conference on design theory held in New York in 1974. \n\n在1974年纽约举行的一个特别的讨论设计理论的会议上，科学家和设计师之间的交流问题非常明显。\n\nThis conference was interesting for several reasons, the most significant directly related to the content of the meeting itself. \n\n这次会议因为一些原因变得十分有趣，最重要的一个原因是直接关系到会议本身的内容。\n\nReviewed in one of the initial papers, the“wicked problems” approach to design proved to be one of the central themes to which the participants often returned when seeking a connection between their remarkably diverse and seemingly in commensurate applications of design. \n\n在一开始的一篇论文中，“抗解问题”的设计方法被证明为一个需要被讨论的核心主题，因为与会者在寻找不同设计案例之间的关联时经常回到这个话题上，无论这些案例是存在显著差异还是看着差不多。\n\nAlso significant was the dfficulty that most of the participants had in understanding each other. \n\n另外一个重要的原因是，大部分的与会者都很难深入理解对方。\n\nAlthough an observation of an outsider on the dynamics of the meeting, it is an excellent example of a“wicked problem”of design thinking.\n\n虽然这是一名局外人对会议的动态的观察，但这是关于「设计思维中的抗解问题」的一个很好案例。\n\nThe wicked problems approach was formulated by Horst Rittel in the 1960s, when design methodology was a subject of intense interest. \n\n抗解问题的方法是在20世纪60年代由 Horst Rittel 提出的，当时设计方法的研究是一个非常热门的课题。\n\nA mathematician, designer, and former teacher at the Hochschule fuir Gestaltung  (HfG) Ulm, Rittel sought an alternative to the linear, step-by-step model of the design process being explored by many designers and design theorists. \n\n作为一名数学家，设计师，乌尔姆造型学院的前教师，和很多设计师和设计理论家探索传统线性过程模型的思路不同，Rittel 寻求另外一类解决方案。\n\nAlthough there are many variations of the linear model, its proponents hold that thedesign process is divided into two distinct phases: problem defini- tion and problem solution. \n\n虽然有许多不同的线性模型，它们的支持者都一直认为：设计过程分为两个不同的阶段：问题的定义和解决问题。\n\nProblem definition is an analytic sequence in which the designer determines all of the elements of the problem and specifies all of the requirements that a successful design solution must have. \n\n问题定义是一个分析过程，设计者在其中确定问题的所有元素，并指定成功的设计解决方案必须具备的所有需求。\n\nProblem solution is a synthetic sequence in which the various requirements are combined and balanced against each other, yielding a final plan to be carried into production.\n\n问题解决是一个整合的过程，在这个过程中，各种需求相互结合并相互平衡，产生一个最终的方案并进行执行。\n\nIn the abstract, such a model may appear attractive because it suggests a methodological precision that is, in its key features, independent from the perspective of the individual designer. \n\n从理论上来说，这样的模型看上去非常有吸引力，是因为它表明了方法的有效程度和设计师的个人认知无关，这是它非常关键的一个特征。\n\nIn fact,many scientists and business professionals, as well as some designers, continue to find the idea of a linear model attractive, believing that it represents the only hope for a“logical”understanding of the design process. \n\n事实上，许多科学家和商业分析师、设计师一直能够感受到线性模型的吸引力，认为这是对理性理解设计过程的唯一希望。\n\nHowever, some critics were quick to point out two obvious points of weakness: one, the actual sequence of design thinking and decision making is not a simple linear process; and two, the problems addressed by designers do not, in actual practice, yield to any linear analysis and synthesis yet proposed.\n\n然而，一些批评家很快指出了两个明显的弱点：一，设计思维和决策的实际过程不是一个简单的线性过程；二、设计者所提出的问题在实际中并不适用于任何一种线性分析和整合的模型。\n\nRittel argued that most of the problems addressed by designers are wicked problems. \n\nRittel认为，大多数的设计师提出的问题是「抗解问题」。\n\nAs described in the first published report of Rittel's idea, wicked problems are a \"class of social system problems which are ill-formulated, where the information is confusing, where there are many clients and decision makers with conflicting values, and where the ramifications in the whole system are thoroughly confusing. \"\n\n在最开始的一些报告中， Rittel认为「抗解问题」是一类很难被架构的「社会系统问题」，其中的信息是混乱的，许多客户和决策者的价值观冲突，整个系统的结果难以预料，让人觉得十分困扰。\n\nThis is an amusing description of what confronts designers in every new situation.\n\n这在描述 设计师在新场景下所面临的挑战时，会让人觉得十分好笑。\n\nBut most important, it points toward a fundamental issue that lies behind practice: the relationship between determinacy and indeterminacy in design thinking. \n\n但最重要的是，它指向了实践背后的一个基本问题：设计思维中的确定性与不确定性之间的关系。\n\nThe linear model of design thinking is based on determinate problems which have definite conditions. \n\n设计思维的线性模型是建立在确定条件的基础上的。\n\nThe designer's task is to identify those conditions precisely and then calculate a solution. \n\n设计者的任务是精确识别这些条件，然后计算解决方案。\n\nIn contrast, the wicked-problems approach suggests that there is a fundamental indeterminacy in all but the most trivial design problems一 problems where, as Rittel suggests, the“wickedness”has already been taken out to yield determinate or analytic problems. \n\n相反，「抗解问题」这种思考方式表明，在普遍的设计问题有一个基本的不确定性。而 Rittel 认为，当我们去分析这些问题时，「抗解」这个特性会被我们忽略以便于分析问题或进行决策。\n\nTo understand what this means, it is important to recognize that indeterminacy is quite different from undetermined. \n\n要理解这意味着什么，重要的是要认识到「不确定性」与「不确定」是完全不同的。\n\nIndeterminacy implies that there are no definitive conditions or limits to design problems. \n\n不确定性意味着设计问题没有确定的条件或限制。\nThis is evident, for example, in the ten properties of wicked problems that Rittel initially identified in 1972.\n这一点是十分明显的。在1972年 Rittel 就初步确定了「抗解问题」的十个特性。\n\n(1) Wicked problems have no definitive formulation, but every formulation of a wicked problem corresponds to the formulation of a solution.  \n\n（1）「抗解问题」没有明确的架构定义，但每一个「抗解问题」都会有其适用的解法框架。\n\n(2) Wicked problems have no stopping rules.\n\n（2）「抗解问题」没有停止的规则。\n是不是意味着它的规则是在不断发展的？\n\n  (3) Solutions to wicked problems cannot be true or false,only good or bad.\n\n（3）「抗解问题」没有对或错的解决方案，只有好与坏的解决方案。\n\n(4) In solving wickedproblems there is no exhaustive list of admissible operations.\n\n（4）在解决「抗解问题」时没有详尽的执行清单。\n\n (5) For every wicked problem there is always more than one possible explanation, with explanations depending on the Weltanschauung of the designer.\n\n（5）每一个「抗解问题」总是有多个可能的解释，解释则完全取决于设计师的世界观与人生观。\nWeltanschauung identifies the intellectual perspective of the designer as an integral part of the design process.\nWeltanschauung 意味着 把 设计者的主观认知 作为设计过程的主要因素。\n即完全凭借设计师的主观经验和三观。\n\n (6) Every wicked problem is a symptom of another “higher level \" problem. \n\n（6）每一个「抗解问题」都是另一个“更高层次”问题的征兆（一个局部）。\n\n (7) No formulation and solution of a wicked problem has a definitive test.\n\n（7）「抗解问题」的框架与解决方案都没有一个明确的测试方法来判断对与错。\n\n (8) Solving a wickedproblem is a “one shot” operation,with no room for trial and error.\n\n（8）解决「抗解问题」是一鼓作气式的，它没有试验和错误的空间。\n\n (9) Every wicked problem is unique.\n\n（9）每一个「抗解问题」都是独一无二的。\n\n(10) The wicked problem solver has no right to be wrong——they are fully responsible for their actions.\n\n（10）「抗解问题」解决者没有错误的权利——他们是对自己的行为完全负责的。\n\nThis is a remarkable list, and it is tempting to go no further than elaborate the meaning of each property, providing concrete examples drawn from every area of design thinking. \n\n这是一个引人关注的特性清单。如果为了偷点懒，或许我们只需进一步阐述每一个特性的含义，提供从设计思维的各个领域的具体例子来验证就好了。\n\nBut to do so would leave a fundamental question unanswered.\n\n但这样做会留下一个根本性的问题。\n\n Why are design problems indeterminate and, therefore, wicked? \n\n为什么设计问题是不确定的，从而变成「抗解」的？\n\nNeither Rittel nor any of those studying wicked problems has attempted to answer this question, so the wicked-problems approach has remained only a description of the social reality of designing rather than the beginnings of a well-grounded theory of design.\n\nRittel 或者其他任何研究「抗解问题」的人都没有试图去回答这个问题。所以「抗解问题」的思考方式仍然只是一种对社会现实中设计的描述，而不是对一个基础扎实的设计理论的开端。\n\nHowever, the answer to the question lies in something rarely considered: the peculiar nature of the subject matter of design. \n\n然而，这个问题的答案在于一些很少被思考过的东西上，那就是设计主题天生就是非常特殊的。\n\nDesign problems are “indeterminate” and “wicked” because design has no special subject matter of its own apart from what a designer conceives it to be.\n\n设计问题是不确定的、「抗解」的原因，是设计除了设计师自己设想的以外，没有自己专门研究的主题。\n\n The subject matter of design is potentially universal in scope, because design thinking may be applied to any area of human experience. \n\n设计的主题在广度上可能是无穷尽的，因为设计思维可以应用于人类经验的任何领域。\n\nBut in the process of application, the designer must discover or invent a particular subject out of the problems and issues of specific circumstances. \n\n但在应用的过程中，设计者必须从特定的问题和问题中发现或发明特定的主题。\n\nThis sharply contrasts with the disciplines of science, which are concerned with understanding the principles, laws, rules, or structures that are necessarily embodied in existing subject matters. \n\n这与科学学科形成了鲜明的对比，这些学科很重要的一块便是理解在已有主题中必然存在的原则、规律或结构。\n\nSuch subject matters are undetermined or under-determined, requiring further investigation to make them more fully determinate. \n\n这样的研究主题也许还有待确定，也许是证据不足，需要进一步调查，使之更能够被完全确定。\n\nBut they are not radically indeterminate in a way directly comparable to that of design.\n\n但和设计学科研究的主题相比，它们并不是根本上无法确定的。\n\nDesigners conceive their subject matter in two ways on two levels: general and particular. \n\n设计师往往从普遍和特殊这两个层面构思他们的研究主题。\n\nOn a general level, a designer forms an idea or a working hypothesis about the nature of products or the nature of the humanmade in the world. \n\n?在普遍这个层面上，设计师形成一个关于产品类型或世界上人类类型的想法或「基础假设」。?\n\nThis is the designer's view of what is meant, for example, by the“artificial”in relation to the “natural.”\n\n这是设计者的观点，例如，“人工”与“自然”。\n\nIn this sense, the designer holds a broad view of the nature of design and the proper scope of its application. \n\n在这个程度上说，设计师就有了一个对设计的本质及其适用范围的大局观。\n\nIndeed, most designers, to the degree that they have reflected on their discipline, will gladly, if not insistently, explain on a general level what the subject matter of design is. \n\n事实上，回顾大多数设计师的行为，他们会更乐意从整体的角度来去解释的设计的研究主题，如果你不坚持要他们深入到特殊层面的话。\n\nWhen developed and well presented, these explanations are philosophies or proto-philosophies of design that exist within a plurality of alternative views. \n\n这些解释经过发展和充分展现后，会变成设计的哲学或者是哲学的初步形态，存在于设计的诸多子领域中。\n相当于抽象了设计的共性？\n\nThey provide an essential framework for each designer to understand and explore the materials, methods, and principles of design thinking. \n\n他们为每一位设计师提供了一个基本的框架来理解和探索设计思维的物质、方法和原则。\n\nBut such philosophies do not and cannot constitute sciences of design in the sense of any natural, social, or humanistic science. \n\n但这样的哲学并不能等同于设计的科学，从任何自然、社会或人文科学的那种程度来说。\n\nThe reason for this is simple: design is fundamentally concerned with the particular, and there is no science of the particular.\n\n原因很简单：设计基本上与特殊有关，而特殊没有科学一说。\n\nIn actual practice, the designer begins with what should be called a quasi-subject matter, tenuously existing within the problems and issues of specific circumstances. \n\n在实践中，设计师从应该称为「准主题」的主题（他们仅存在于具体情况下的问题中）开始，\n\nOut of the specific possibilities of a concrete situation, the designer must conceive a design that will lead to this or that particular product. \n\n出于具体情况的特定的可能性，设计者必须构思出一种设计，引导出某种特定的产品。\n\nA quasi-subject matter is not an undetermined subject waiting to be made determinate. \n\n「准主题」不是一个准备被确定的待确定的主题。\n就是说「准对象」不是一个从0填充到100的对象，而是需要去确定应该是从0到1，还是从0到100，还是说从0到-100的一个对象。需要去架构它的框架，然后才是填充内容的过程。\n\nIt is an indeterminate subject waiting to be made specific and concrete.\n\n它是一个不确定的主题，需要被特殊化和具体化。\n\nFor example, a client's brief does not present a definition of the subject matter of a particular design application. \n\n例如，客户机的需求说明往往没有给出具体的设计主题的定义或者特定的设计应用。\n\nIt presents a problem and a set of issues to be considered in resolving that problem.\n\n它提出了一个问题和在解决这个问题时要考虑的一系列问题。\n\n In situations where a brief specifies in great detail the particular features of the product to be planned, it otten does so because an owner, corporate executive, or manager has attempted to perform the critical task of transforming problems and issues into a working hypothesis about the particular features of the product to be designed. \n\n但是在某种情况下，概要会非常详细地指定要计划中的产品的特定特性。这种情况往往是因为老板，企业高管，或经理试图完成关键任务。这个关键任务是把问题和限制条件转化成产品具体功能特性的「基础假设」。\n\nIn effect, someone has attempted to take the“wickedness”out. \n\n事实上，有人试图把「抗解性」排除掉。\n\nEven in this situation, however, the conception of particular features remains only a possibility that may be subject to change through discussion and argument. \"\n\n然而，即使在这种情况下，特定特征的概念可能通过讨论和论证而被改变。\n\nThis is where placements take on special significance as tools of design thinking. \n\n这就是「置换」作为一种设计思维工具所具有的特殊意义。\n\nThey allow the designer to position and reposition the problems and issues at hand.\n\n他们允许设计师对手头的问题和限制条件进行定位和重定位。\n\n Placements are the tools by which a designer intuitively or deliberately shapes a design situation, identifying the views of all participants, the issues which concern them, and the invention that will serve as a working hypothes is for exploration and development. \n\n设计师有意识或无意识地用「置换」工具塑造明确的设计场景，在这个过程中确定所有参与者的看法、他们关注问题以及设计师自己心中用于探索和发展的「基础假设」。\ninvention 有“内心捏造的东西”这个意思。\n\nIn this sense, the placements selected by a designer are the same as what determinate subject matters are for the scientist. \n\n在这个意义上，设计者使用的「置换」工具和科学家研究的主题所用的工具是一样的。\n\nThey are the quasi-subject matter of design thinking, from which the designer fashions a working hypothesis suited to special circumstances.\n\n它们是设计思维的「准主题」，通过他们，设计师得出适合特殊情况的「基础假设」。\n\nThis helps to explain how design functions as an integrative discipline. \n\n这有助于解释作为一门综合性学科，设计是如何运足的。\n\nBy using placements to discover or invent a working hypothesis, the designer establishes a principle of relevance for knowledge from the arts and sciences, determining how such knowledge may be useful to design thinking in a particular circumstance without immediately reducing design to one or another of these disciplines. \n\n通过使用「置换」来发现或创造一个「基础假设」，设计师建立了一个与科学艺术有关的知识的原则，确定这种知识在特定环境下对于设计思维有多大作用，而不必马上将设计局限到其中任何一个学科中。\n\nIn effect, the working hypothesis that will lead to a particular product is the principle of relevance, guiding the efforts of designers to gather all available knowledge bearing on how a product is finally planned.\n\n实际上，指向特定产品的「基础假设」是一种「相关性原则」，用户指导设计师去收集所有可用的知识，这些知识描述了产品最终应该是如何被规划的。\n\nBut does the designer's working hypothesis or principle of relevance suggest that the product itself is a determinate subject matter?\n\n但是设计师的「基础假设」或「相关性原则」是否表明产品本身是一个确定的主题呢？\n\nThe answer involves a critical but often blurred distinction between design thinking and the activity of production or making. \n\n答案涉及到一个设计思维和生产或制造活动之间的区别，这个区别非常关键但往往被模糊掉。\n\nOnce a product is conceived, planned, and produced, it may indeed become an object for study by any of the arts and sciences--history, economics, psychology, sociology, or anthropology. \n\n一旦产品被构思、计划和生产，它就可能成为任何一门科学艺术（历史、经济学、心理学、社会学或人类学等）的研究对象。\n\nIt may even become an object for study by a new humanistic science of production that we could call the “science of the artificial”, directed toward undertanding the nature, form, and uses of humanmade products in all of their generic kinds. \n\n它甚至可能成为新的人本主义生产科学（我们不妨称它为「人造科学」）的研究对象，可以直观理解各种人造物的性质、形态、和使用方式。\n\nBut in all such studies, the activities of design thinking are easily forgotten or are reduced to the kind of product that is finally produced. \n\n但在所有这些研究中，设计思维活动很容易被遗忘，或者被简化为最终产生的产品。\n\nThe problem for designers is to conceive and plan what does not yet exist, and this occurs in the context of the indeterminacy of wicked problems, before the final result is known.\n\n设计师面临的问题是在知道结果之前就去设想和计划不存在的东西。而这个问题往往是在面对「抗解问题」这种存在「不确定性」这样背景下发生的。\n\nThis is the creative or inventive activity that Herbert Simon has in mind when he speaks of design as a science of the artificial. \n\n这是希尔伯特·西蒙 在谈到设计作为一门「人造科学」时，他所考虑的创造性或发明性的活动。\n\nWhat he means is “devising artifacts to attain goals”  or, more broadly，“doctrine about the design process”.\n\n他的意思就是“设计人造物来实现目标”，或者更广泛地说，“关于设计过程的理论”。\n\nIn this sense, Simon's science of the artificial is perhaps closer to what Dewey means by technology as a systematic discipline of experimental thinking. \n\n？从这个意义上说，西蒙的「人造科学」或许更接近于杜威所说的一种实验思维下的系统学科。？\n真的不知道啥意思额。\n\nHowever, Simon has little to say about the difference between designing a product and making it. \n\n但是，西蒙对于设计和制造之间的区别讨论得并不多。\n\nConsequently, the “search” procedures and decision-making protocols that he proposes for design are largely analytic, shaped by his philosophic view of the determinacies that follow from the natural laws that surround artifacts.\n\n因此可以认为他为设计提出的“搜索”程序和决策方案主要是分析型的。这些来自于他对确定性——即遵循人造物中的法则、规则、结构——的哲学思考。\n\nFor all of the insight Simon has in distinguishing the artificial as a domain of humanmade products different from objects created by natural processes, he does not capture the radical sense in which designers explore the essence of what the artificial may be in human experlence. \n\n因为西蒙把所有的洞察力都放在了区分「人造」是作为一个人造物的领域还是通过自然过程创建物体这个问题上，所以他没有捕捉到这个激进的场景：设计师们在人类经验中探索的「人造」是什么的本质。\n\nThis is a synthetic activity related to indeterminacy, not an activity of making what is undetermined in natural laws more determinate in artifacts. \n\n这是一种与不确定性有关的整合活动，而不是在根本规则下让人造物的未确定性变得更为确定的活动。\n\nIn short, Simon appears to have conflated two sciences of the artificial : an inventive science of design thinking which has no subject matter aside from what the designer conceives it to be, and a science of existing humanmade products whose nature Simon happens to believe is a manipulation of material and behavioral laws of nature.\n\n总之，西蒙似乎把两类科学合并在了一起：一类是设计思维的发明科学，这一类科学除了设计师设想的以外没有其他任何研究主题。另一类则是关于人造物的科学，其本质西蒙？碰巧？认为是对物质与行为规律的控制。 \n后半段话真是无比晦涩难懂\n\nDesign is a remarkably supple discipline, amenable to radically different interpretations in philosophy as well as in practice. \n\n设计是一门非常灵活的学科，可以从哲学和实践中得到完全不同的解释。\n\nBut the flexibility of design often leads to popular misunderstanding and clouds efforts to understand its nature. \n\n但是设计的灵活性常常会引起人们的普遍误解和理解其本质的「云」般的努力。\n\nThe history of design is not merely a history of objects. \n\n设计的历史不仅仅是一个对象的历史。\n\nIt is a history of the changing views of subject matter held by designers and the concrete objects conceived, planned, and produced as expressions of those views. \n\n这是一个设计师们反复切换研究主题视角的历史，具体对象的构思、计划和生产都是这些观点的表达。\n\nOne could gofurther and say that the history of design history is a record of the design historians' views regarding what they conceive to be the subject matter of design.\n\n可以进一步说，设计史的历史是记录设计史学家们把什么当成主要设计主题的历史。\nWe have been slow to recognize the peculiar indeterminacy of subject matter in design and its impact on the nature of design thinking. \n我们花了很久时间才认识到设计中的主题的特殊的不确定性，及其对设计思维本质的影响。\nAs a consequence, each of the sciences that have come into contact with design has tended to regard design as an ‘applied\" version of its own knowledge, methods, and principles. \n？因此，每一个接触到设计的科学都倾向于把设计看作是自己知识、方法和原则的“应用”版本。？\nThey see in design an instance of their own subject matter and treat design as a practical demonstration of the scientific principles of that subject matter. \n他们在设计中看到自己的研究主题的一个实例，并把设计作为一种关于该主题的科学原则的显示呈现。\nThus, we have the odd, recurring situation in which design is alternately regarded as“applied\" natural science，“applied” social science, or“applied”fine art. \n因此，我们有一种奇怪的、反复出现的情形，即设计被视为“应用”自然科学、应用社会科学或应用美术。\nNo wonder designers and members of the scientific community often have difficulty communicating.\n难怪设计师和科学界的成员经常沟通困难。 \nCopyright © ArvinX all right reserved，powered by Gitbook该文件修订时间：\n2017-12-04 05:01:26\n"},"5- 设计与技术.html":{"url":"5- 设计与技术.html","title":"

\n\n如果把设计建设成一门科技文化下的博雅教育，还有许多问题有待探索。\n\nBut as it continues to unfold in the work of individual designers and in reflection on the nature of their work, design is slowly restoring the richer meaning of the term“technology” that was all but lost with the rise of the Industrial Revolution. \n\n？但随着它继续在个人设计师的作品中展开，在对他们工作本质的反思中，设计正在慢慢恢复“技术”这个术语的丰富含义。（曾经工业革命的兴起使设计失去了「技术」的意义。）？\n\nMost people continue to think of technology in terms of its product rather than its form as a discipline of systematic thinking. \n\n大多数人一直认为技术和产品本身息息相关，而不是一门有系统思维的学科。\n\nThey regard technology as things and machines, observing with concern that the machines of our culture often appear out of human control, threatening to trap and enslave rather than liberate. \n\n他们把技术视为实体和机器，观察到我们的机器经常出现在超出人类的控制，有奴役人类的威胁，而不是解放。\n\nBut there was a time in an earlier period of Western culture when technology was a human activity operating throughout the liberal arts.\n\n但在早期的西方文化中，有一段时间科技是一种贯穿整个博雅教育的人类活动。\n\nEvery liberal art had its own technologia or systematic discipline.\n\n每一类博雅教育都有它自己的工学或系统的学科。\n\n To possess that technology or discipline of thinking was to possess the liberal art, to be human, and to be free in seeking one's place in the world.\n\n拥有这种技术或思维的学科，就是拥有博雅教育，成为人，在世界上自由地生活。\n\nDesign also has a technologia, and it is manifested in the plan for every new product. \n\n设计也有工学，它体现在计划的每一个新产品上。\n\nThe plan is an argument, reflecting the deliberations of designers and their efforts to integrate knowledge in new ways, suited to specific circumstances and needs. \n\n这种计划是一个论据，反映了设计师的思考以及他们努力以新的方式去整合知识来适应特定的情况和需要。\n\nIn this sense, design is emerging as a new discipline of practical reasoning and argumentation, directed by individual designers toward one or another on its major thematic varlations in the twentieth century: design as communication, construction, strategic planning or systemic integration. \n\n从这个意义上说，设计是一种新兴的实践推理和论证的新学科，由设计师向一个或另一个在二十世纪主要专题动态：设计沟通、建设、战略规划、系统整合。\n由设计师向一个或另一个在二十世纪主要专题动态：设计沟通、建设、战略规划、系统整合。\n\nThe power of design as deliberation and argument lies in overcoming the limitations of mere verbal or symbolic argument ——the separation of words and things, or theory and practice that remains a source of disruption and confusion in contemporary culture. \n\n？设计作为思考和论证的力量在于克服仅仅是口头或象征性的论点的局限性——在当代文化中仍然是混乱和混乱的根源的词语和事物、理论或实践的分离。？\n\nArgument in design thinking moves toward the concrete interplay and interconnection of signs, things,actions, and thoughts. \n\n设计思维中的论点朝着符号、实物、行为和思想的具体相互作用和相互联系的方向发展。\n\nEvery designer's sketch, blueprint, flow chart, graph, three-dimensional model, or other product proposal is an example of such argumentation.\n\n每个设计师的草图、工程图、流程图、图像、三维模型或其他产品提案就是这种论点的一个例子。\n\nHowever, there is persistent confusion about the different modes of argumentation employed by the various design professions. \n\n然而，人们对各种设计专业使用的不同论证模式一直存在着困惑。\n\nFor example, industrial design, engineering, and marketing each employ the discipline of design thinking, yet their arguments are often framed in sharply different logical modalities.\n\n例如，工业设计、工程和市场营销都使用设计思维的学科，但他们的论证往往以不同的逻辑形式加以阐述。 \n\nIndustrial design tends to stress what is possible in the conception and planning of products; engineering tends to stress what is necessary in considering materlals, mechanisms, structures, and systems; while marketing tends to stress what is contingent in the changing attitudes and preferences of potential users. \n\n工业设计往往强调在产品概念和规划的可行性；工程往往强调什么是必要的考虑材料、机械、结构和系统；而营销往往强调什么是改变潜在用户的态度和喜好的关键因素。\n\nBecause of these modal differences in approaching design problems, three of the most important professions of design thinking are often regarded as bitter opponents in the design enterprise, irreconcilably distant from each other.\n\n由于在思考设计问题这些不同情景，这三种运用设计思维最重要的职业通常被视为在设计企业的激烈的对手，彼此远远不可调和。\nWhat design as a liberal art contributes to this situation is a new awareness of how argument is the central theme that cuts across the many technical methodologies employed in each design profession. \n在这种情况下，作为一门博雅教育能够帮助人们意识到中心论点是如何贯穿于设计行业使用的许多技术方法的。\nDifferences of modality may be complementary ways of arguing-reciprocal expressions of what conditions and shapes the“useful”in human experience. \n模式的差异可能是互补的方式来论证什么样的条件和形状在人类经验中的“有用”。\n这个也有感觉，就是你用了同样的基本思维，然后套在不同的场景下，然后得出对应的一个结论。\n\nAs a liberal art of technological culture, design points toward a new attitude about the appearance of products. \n\n作为一种技术文化的博雅教育，设计指向了一种新的关于产品表象的态度。\n\nAppearance must carry a deeper, integrative argument about the nature of the artificial in human experience. \n\n外表必须对人类经验中人造物的本质进行更深入、更全面的论证。\n\nThis argument is a synthesis of three lines of reasoning: the ideas of designers and manufacturers about their products; the internal operational logic of products; and the desire and ability of human beings to use products in everyday life in ways that reflect personal and social values. \n\n这一论点综合了三条线索：设计师和制造商关于他们产品的想法；产品的内部运作逻辑；以及人们去用产品的欲望和能力（在使用中会呈现出个人与社会价值）。\n\nEffective design depends on the ability of designers to integrate all three lines of reasoning. \n\n有效的设计取决于设计师整合所有三条线索的能力。\n\nBut not as isolated factors that can be added together in a simple mathematical total, or as isolated subject matters that can be studied separately and joined late in the product development process.\n\n但这不是作为一个简单的数学总量相加的孤立因素，也不能作为可以分开研究的独立对象，在产品开发过程中后期加入。\n\nThe new liberal art of design thinking is turning to the modality of impossibility. \n\n设计思维的新博雅教育转向不可能性形态。\n\nIt points, for example, toward the impossibility of rigid boundaries between industrial design, engineering, and marketing.\n\n 例如，它指出工业设计、工程和市场之间不可能有严格的界限。\n\nIt points toward the impossibility of relying on any one of the sciences  (natural, social, or humanistic) for adequate solutions to what are the inherently wicked problems of design thinking. \n\n它指出，不可能依赖任何单独一门科学（自然科学、社会科学的或人文科学）来解决设计思维中存在的「抗解问题」。\n\nFinally,It points toward something that is often forgotten, that what many people call \"impossible\" may actually only be a limitation of imagination that can be overcome by better design thinking. \n\n最后，它指向一些经常被遗忘的东西，许多人所说的“不可能”实际上只是想象力的局限，可以通过更好的设计思维来克服。\n\nThis is not thinking directed toward a technological “quick fix” in hardware but toward new integrations of signs, things, actions, and environments that address the concrete needs and values of human being s in diverse circumstances.\n\n这不是一种 面向硬件的技术“快速修复” 思维，而是面向一种整合符号、产品，行为、环境来解决不同环境下人的具体需要和价值的思维。\n\nIndividuals trained in the traditional arts and sciences may continue to be puzzled by the neoteric art of design. \n\n在传统艺术和科学的训练下的设计师或许一直被现代设计艺术所困扰。\n\nBut the masters of this new liberal art are practical men and women, and the discipline of thinking that they employ is gradually becoming accessible to all individuals in everyday life. \n\n但是，这种新博雅教育的主人们是讲求实践的人们，他们所采用的思维方式正逐渐被日常生活中的所有人所接受。\nA common discipline of design thinking——more than the particular products created by that discipline today——is changing our culture, not only in its external manifestations but in its internal character.\n一个设计思维的通用学科——不仅仅现今是创造特定产品的那个学科——正在改变着我们的文化，不仅表现在外在表现上，也表现在它的内在特征中。 \nCopyright © ArvinX all right

matters这个词在这篇文章里面既有学科的意思，也有主题的意思。\n\nThis circle of learning was divided into particular subject matters, each with a proper method or set of methods suitable to its exploration. \n\n它的学习范围被分成了一些特定的学科，每个学科都有一个或者一套适当的、适合于其探索的方法。\ncommon problems 一般问题\n个人认为是普遍存在于生活中的各种问题，也可以用“通用”、“常见”这样的词来形容这类问题，在翻译上统一采用「一般问题」。\nneo-positivist 新实证主义者\n\n逻辑实证主义（英语：logical positivism）和逻辑经验主义，共同形成了新实证主义，也被称为科学经验主义，是以确证主义为核心的西方哲学运动。1920年代后期开始，一群哲学观点相似的哲学家、科学家和数学家等组成维也纳学派，发展出逻辑实证主义。\n维也纳小组的兴趣重点在于对科学的整合和统一，以及对科学方法的正确描绘。他们的认为这些工作将成为诸多形而上学争论的最终解决方案。这样一来，哲学的建设性作用就在于对科学理论和语言的分析。逻辑实证主义运动可以被看做是经验主义哲学的发展。这种发展建立于：\n\n对经验科学其方法的更深刻认识\n形式逻辑学的发展\n\n这种发展表现在逻辑学对抽象概念进行定义，以及描述合理推论的结构的能力大大增加了。一定程度上，罗素为逻辑实证主义运动奠定了基础。他的逻辑学和“逻辑构造”（logical construction）概念扮演了尤为重要的角色。\n实证主义（positivism）是一种以“实际验证”为中心的哲学思想。广义而言，任何种类的哲学体系，只要求知于经验材料，拒绝、排斥先验或形而上学的思辨，都为实证主义。狭义而言，实证主义则指法国哲学家孔德的哲学，认为对现实之认识只有靠特定科学及对寻常事物的观察才能获得。\n实证主义又称实证论，其中心论点是：事实必须是透过观察或感觉经验，去认识每个人身处的客观环境和外在事物。实证论者认为，虽然每个人接受的教育不同，但他们用来验证感觉经验的原则，并无太大差异。实证主义的目的，在希望建立知识的客观性。\n\nCopyright
