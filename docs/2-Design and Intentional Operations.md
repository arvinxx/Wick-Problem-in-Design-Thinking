# Design and Intentional Operations / 设计与「刻意行为」

> The beginning of the study of design as a liberal art can be traced to the cultural upheaval that occurred in the early part of the twentieth century. 

作为一门博雅学科来研究的话，设计的开端可以追溯到二十世纪初发生的文化剧变。

> The key feature of this upheaval was described by John Dewey in *The Quest for Certainty* as the perception of a new center of the universe.

这种聚变的关键特征在约翰·杜威 (John Dewey) 的  《确定性的寻求：一种知行关系的研究》中心。

> The old center of the universe was the mind knowing by means of an equipment of powers complete within itself, and merely exercised upon an antecedent external material equally complete within itself.

?旧的领域中心的思想是，通过 自我完成 的 技能/设备 of 能力 来了解，并且仅通过   自我完成 的以前的外部材料  来练习?

> The new center is indefinite interactions taking place within a course of nature which is not fixed and complete, but which is capable of direction to new and different results through the mediation of intentional operations.

新中心是在自然过程中发生的模糊的相互作用，它不是固定、完整的，而是可以通过「刻意行为」来导向新的、不同结果的。

> What Dewey describes here is the root of the difference between the old and new liberal arts, between specialization in the facts of a subject matter and the use of new disciplines of integrative thinking.

?杜威在这里描述的是旧新博雅学科之间的根本区别，也是在客观事物专业细分和新的综合思维的使用的根本区别?

> Dewey observes, however, that the meaning and implications of the new direction are still not fully understood.

然而，杜威观察到，新方向的含义和隐喻还没有完全被理解。

> Nowadays we have a messy conjunction of notions that are consistent neither with one another nor with the tenor of our actual life. 

如今，我们脑海中混杂在一起的概念十分混乱，既不彼此一致，也不符合我们实际生活的节奏。

> Knowledge is still regarded by most thinkers as direct grasp of ultimate reality, although the practice of knowing has been assimilated to the procedure of the useful arts; -involving, that is to say, doing that manipulates and arranges natural energies. 

大多数思想家仍然把知识视为终极现实的直接把握，及时在实践认知中也会使用实用艺术的创作程序。换句话说，就是从自然中获得需要的能量。

> Again while science is said to lay hold of reality, yet“art” instead of being assigned a lower rank is equally esteemed and honored. 

再次需要被强调的，虽然科学是用来把握现实的，但是“艺术”是被平等看待和尊敬的，而不是当成低一等的东西。

> Carrying these observations further, Dewey explores the new relationship between science, art, and practice. 
>

通过持续进一步观察，杜威探索了科学、艺术和实践之间的新关系。

> He suggests in Experience and Nature that knowledge is no longer achieved by direct conformity of ideas with the fixed orders of nature; knowledge is achieved by a new kind of art directed toward orders of change.

在《经验与自然》中他提到知识不再是由思想与自然规律的直接结合而获得的；知识是由一种新的艺术导向的，它是朝向变化的秩序而实现的。

> But if modern tendencies are justified in putting art and creation first, then the implications of this position should be avowed and carried through. 

但如果现代倾向有理由把艺术和创造放在第一位，那么这个位置的影响应公开，并且继续贯彻进行。

> It would then be seen that science is an art, that art is practice, and that the only distinction worth drawing is not be tween practice and theory, but between those modes of practice that are not intelligent, not inherently and immediately enjoyable, and those which are full of enjoyed meanings. 

由此可以看出，科学是一门艺术，而艺术则是实践，唯一值得说明的差别不是实践与理论之间的差别，而是实践模式的区别。因为有的模式不明智、不固有，并且不能立即感受到，而有些则是富有意义。

> Although the neo-positivists courted Dewey for a time, it was apparent that his understanding of the development of science in the twentieth century was quite different from their understanding.

虽然新实证主义曾经尝试过拉拢杜威。但是很明显，他对在第二十世纪科学发展的理解是和他们完全不同的。

> Instead of treating science as primary and art as secondary, Dewey pointed toward science as art.

杜威没有以科学为主，艺术为次，而是把科学当作艺术。

> The consideration that completes the ground for assimIlating science to art is the fact that assignment of scientific status in any given case rests upon facts which are experimentally produced. 

完成科学与艺术的融合，需要考虑是一个事实，那就是在任何情况下，?科学地位的分配?取决于实验的结果。

> Science is now the product of operations deliberately undertaken in conformity with a plan or project that has the properties of a working hypothesis. 

现在的科学是一系列周密计划和精密操作的产物，它现在具有一个很重要的属性就是：「基础假设」。

> What Dewey means by “art”in this context is crucial to understanding the new role of design and technology in contemporary culture.

杜威在这一背景下所指的“艺术”对于理解当代文化中设计和技术的新角色至关重要。

> After a period in which natural knowledge progressed by borrowing from the industrial crafts, science entered upon a period of steady and ever-accelerated growth by means of deliberate invention of such appliances on its own account. 

过去的一个时期内，自然的知识是通过进行工业工艺的实践经验不断增长的，在此之后，科学进入了一个稳定甚至加速增长的时期，这个阶段的特点是，人们基于自己的目的发明了各种具有特定功能的物品。

> In order to mark this differential feature of the art which is science, I shall now use the word “technology”. . 

我用「技术」这个词来说明与“技巧”的科学部分的不同性。

> Because of technologies, a circular relationship between the arts of production and science has been established. 

由于技术的存在，“技巧”当中的生产和科学之间的循环关系已经建立。

> What Dewey defines as technology is not what is commonly understood in today's philosophy of technology. 

杜威所定义的「技术」不是当今普遍理解的技术中的「哲学」。

> Instead of meaning knowledge of how to make and use artifacts or the artifacts themselves, technology for Dewey is an art of experimental thinking. 

杜威的「技术」内涵不是一种关于如何制作和使用工件或人工制品的意义知识，而是一种「实验思维」的技巧。

> It is, in fact, intentional operations themselves carried out in the sciences, the arts of production, or social and political action. 

事实上，它是在科学、生产 技巧或社会和政治行动中进行的「刻意行为」。

> We mistakenly identify technology with one particular type of product-hardware-that may result from experimental thinking, but overlook the art that lies behind and provides the basis for creating other types of products.

我们错误地将技术当成是一种特定类型的产品硬件，但是忽略了背后的「技巧」——这可能是实验思维造成的——而正是这种「技巧」反而能够为其他类型产品的产品提供创造基础。

> From this perspective, it is easy to understand why design and design thinking continue to expand their meanings and connections in contemporary culture. 

从这个角度来说，我们很容易理解为什么设计和设计思维在当代文化中继续扩展它们的意义和联系。

> There is no area of contemporary life where design——the plan, project, or working hypothesis which constitutes the“intention”in intentional operations——is not a significant factor in shaping human experience.

在当代生活中任何一个领域，设计——那些计划、项目或假设这些构成刻意行为中的“意图”的要素——都是塑造人类经验的重要因素。

>  Design even extends into the core of traditional scientific activities, where it is employed to cultivate the subject matters that are the focus of scientific curiosity. 

设计甚至延伸进了传统科学活动的核心——用来培养科学好奇心的主题——上。

> But perceiving the existence of such an art only opens the door to further inquiry, to explain what that art is, how it operates, and why it succeeds or fails in particular situations. 

但是，意识到这样一种「技术」的存在，仅仅打开了进一步探究的大门，解释了「技术」是什么，它是如何运作的，以及为什么它在特定情况下成功或失败的原因。

> The challenge is to gain a deeper understanding of design thinking so that more cooperation and mutual benefit is possible between those who apply design thinking to remarkably different problems and subject matters. 

目前面临的挑战是需要加深对设计思维的理解，使那些将设计思维应用于显著不同的问题和主题的人之间有更多的合作和互利。

> This will help to make the practical exploration of design, particularly in the arts of production, more intelligent and meaningful.

这将有助于进行实际的设计探索，尤其是在生产「技艺」方面，变得更智能和有意义的。

> However, a persistent problem in this regard is that discussions between designers and members of the scientific community tend to leave little room for reflection on the broader nature of design and its relation to the arts and sciences, industry and manufacturing, marketing and distribution, and the general public that ultimately uses the results of design thinking. 

然而，在这方面，一个长期存在的问题是，设计师和科学界成员之间的讨论往往没有多少空间去思考设计的更广泛的性质及其与艺术和科学、工业与制造、销售与分销，乃至与那些使用设计思维结果的终端用户之间们的关系。

> Instead of yielding productive integrations, the result is often confusion and a breakdown of communication, with a lack of intelligent practice to carry innovative ideas into objective, concrete embodiment. 

这不但导致没法产生高效的整合创新，还造成混乱的结果与沟通上的障碍。也是因为缺乏有效巧妙的实践，创新的思想也没有能够落地到客观、具体的承载物中。

> In turn, this undermines efforts to reach a clearer understanding of design itself, sometimes driving designers back into a defense of their work in the context of traditional arts and crafts. 

反过来，这也破坏了人们尝试去获取对设计本身更清晰的认识的努力，有时还会使得设计师迫不得已退回到传统艺术和工艺的角度为自己的作品进行辩护。

> Without appropriate reflection to help clarify the basis of communication among all the participants, there is little hope of understanding the foundations and value of design thinking in an increasingly complex technological culture.

如果没有适当的反思来帮助澄清所有参与者之间的交流基础，那么在日益复杂的技术文化中理解设计思维的基础和价值就没有什么希望了。
